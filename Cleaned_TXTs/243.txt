8 Designers have a wide choice of concrete  oor systems for their buildings. They can choose from three basic 9 types available: in situ, precast or hybrid construction. A survey was conducted within the UK construction 2011 industry to investigate, in particular, the construction related factors in uencing the choice of concrete  oor 1 systems. The data collected were subjected to frequency and severity index analyses, Kendall’s concordance 2 test and the chi-squared tests to produce a rank ordering of 12 construction related factors. Five factors 3 were identi ed as being the most important, namely ‘appropriateness of use’, ‘cost’, ‘constructability’, ‘speed’ 4 and ‘health and safety’. These  ve factors re ect current industry emphasis, and therefore could be adopted 5 as the principal criteria for evaluating and selecting concrete  oor systems during the design stage. They 6 could also be used as assessment criteria for developing future systems.
Concrete  oors, frame construction, selection factors
2 3	Introduction
5 Designers have a wide choice of structural systems for 6 concrete frame buildings. They can choose from three 7 basic types available: in situ, precast or hybrid construc8 tion. In a concrete frame building,  oor construction 9 is the most time consuming and costly element (Domel 1011and Ghosh, 1990; Pessiki et al., 1995;
1 1997), representing about 70% of the superstructure
3 The UK concrete frame industry has long been crit4 icized for poor productivity (D’Arcy, 1993; Latham, 5 1994; Chana, 1996; Egan, 1998; Proverbs et al., 1999), 6 and efforts are being made to improve productivity 7 through design and construction processes. The appro8 priate selection of  oor systems, emphasizing ef ciency
9 during construction, can make a signi cant contribution. In order to develop a rational method for making 1 this selection, factors that are important in in uencing
2 the decision need to be established. This would also 3
be helpful in developing new and improved  oor systems.
A previous industry survey by Jenks et al. (1997) identi ed several issues perceived to be important in in uencing the decision to use hybrid structural systems. Barret and Aouad (1998) adopted the same methodology, and identi ed general performance criteria for hybrid structures similar to those obtained by the previous investigators. Ballal (2000) analysed postal questionnaires sent to design engineers and contractors, and established a ranking of 17 design and 24 buildability factors important in selecting structural systems.
Compared with steel or timber, concrete  oor systems are the more appropriate and popular choice for concrete frame buildings, and some examples are given in Table 1. Often the evaluation and selection of concrete  oor systems, carried out mainly during the early design stage, are based on rules of thumb and the experience of the design team. Typically, the evaluation and selection processes would be based on architectural, structural and constructional factors.

Each stage of the evaluation eliminates those that, according to the designer’s judgement, do not meet the standard minimum performance. The end product of this is a list of two or three selected  oor systems to be given more detailed and objective assessment in the subsequent stages of the design, until the best one is found and adopted for the building.
This paper aims to investigate the UK construction industry’s views, speci cally with regard to construction related factors that in uence the choice of concrete  oor systems for concrete frame buildings. Factors in uencing  oor choice as perceived by 41 UK construction industry professionals, mostly consulting engineers and contractors, were analysed. Severity indices were used to rank the factors according to their relative importance. Agreement between the rankings of the two groups was investigated by applying Kendall’s concordance test, in conjunction with the chi-square test. Throughout this paper,  oor systems will imply concrete  oor systems.
Factors in uencing the choice of concrete  oor systems
A literature review was carried out on the assessment and selection of  oor systems. Based on this review and information from industry professionals, a combined list of 29 factors in uencing  oor choice was produced. These factors, which can be used directly as criteria for evaluating and subsequently selecting  oor systems, can be broadly categorized under the headings:
As already stated, only construction related factors were considered in this study, re ecting current industry emphasis. In addition, the factors selected were such that they will be equally applicable irrespective of the form of construction (in situ, precast or hybrid). From the original list of 29 factors, 12 were identi ed as being directly related to the construction process. These are listed and brie y described in Table 2.
Industry-wide views on factors in uencing the selection of concrete  oor systems were obtained by means of a structured postal questionnaire. This method was

chosen in view of its relatively low cost, and also it gives respondents time to complete the questionnaire and return well considered responses (Foddy, 1988; Fowler, 1988; Leedy, 1989).
8 The questionnaire consisted of three main parts. Part I 9 sought background information about the respondent 1011and their organization. In part II, respondents were 1 asked to rate the level of importance of the 12 con2 struction related factors when making a choice of  oor 3 system. The rating was based on a Likert scale of 1–5, 4 where 1 = very low, 2 = low, 3 = moderate, 4 = high 5 and 5 = very high. A reference structure, based on the
6 con guration of the seven-storey European Concrete 7 Building Project in Cardington, Bedfordshire, UK 8 (Goodchild and Moss, 1999) was provided to ensure
9	that respondents used the same base data (Proverbs

The respondents
7 Previous consultations with industry professionals 8 suggested that the majority (85%) of decisions on  oor 9 choice is made by consulting engineers (60%) and 3011contractors (25%), with the remaining 15% being 1 made by architects and quantity surveyors. The 2 proportions for the  rst two groups of professionals 3 tend to support the  ndings of an earlier investigation 4 on hybrid structures (Barrett and Aouad, 1998). 5 Therefore it was decided to adopt this as the basis for 6 proportioning the sample, so as to represent the actual 7 situation as much as possible.
9 uted within the UK construction industry to organi4011zations randomly selected from the Kompass Register 1 of Product and Services (Kompass, 1998) and the New 2 Civil Engineer Consultant File (ICE, 1998).
3 90 were to consulting engineering  rms and 45 were 4 to contractors engaged in building construction.
5 contractors’ list also included manufacturers of indus-
6 trialized  oor systems who often operate as subcontractors. The remaining 15 were distributed to architectural practices (10) and quantity surveying  rms (5), randomly selected from the same register.
Of the original sample, 41 were returned fully completed. Compared with other similar surveys within the UK construction industry, the response rate obtained (27.3 %) is considered to be good. Of these replies, 25 were from consulting engineers, 14 from contractors, one from an architect and one from a quantity surveyor  rm. The proportion of the two primary groups (consultants and contractors) in the returned samples roughly resembles their proportion in making decisions for  oor choice. Because of this, and the fact that samples were drawn at random, the returned sample is considered to be representative of the actual decision-making population.
Analysis and results
Data collected from the survey were ordinal in that the distances between the numbers (ratings) assigned in the Likert scale are not known. The ratings in this scale indicate only a rank order of importance of the factors, rather than how much more important each rating is than the other. Using parametric statistics (means, standard deviations, etc.) to analyse such data would not produce meaningful results, and therefore nonparametric procedures must be adopted (Siegel, 1956; Siegel and Castellan, 1988; Johnson and Bhattacharyya, 1996). The non-parametric procedures adopted for this study were frequency and severity index analysis, Kendall’s concordance test and the chisquare tests.
Ranking the in uencing factors: frequency and severity index analysis
Severity index analysis was conducted on the sample data to rank the factors according to their relative importance. Severity indices rather than mean scores were used since the data were ordinal in nature. In this procedure, frequency analysis was  rst carried out to obtain the percentage ratings of different selection factors. This was done with the help of the statistical software package ‘SPSS’ (Statistical Package for Social Sciences). The percentage ratings (given as ‘valid percentage’ by SPSS) were then used to calculate severity indices via the formula (Elhag and Boussabaine, 1999; Ballal, 2000):
where S.I. is the severity index, fI is the frequency of response, wi is the weight for each rating( = rating in scale/number of points in a scale), and n is the total number of responses. The value ( x 100)/n is the valid percentage as calculated by SPSS.
Based on the magnitude of the severity indices, the factors were arranged in descending order as shown in Table 3. There appears to be a relatively large gap separating the following top  ve factors from the rest:

Investigating agreement: Kendall’s concordance test and the chi-squared test
To ensure that the ranking of the factors obtained above was as a result of a consensus agreement between differing factions of the respondents, and also to check how signi cant this agreement is, two types of statistical test were carried out: Kendall’s concordance test and the chi-squared test. Kendall’s concordance test was applied to investigate, in holistic terms, the agreement between differing groups within the survey, which were effectively the consulting engineers and the contractors. The percentage ratings and severity indices were again calculated for each group to produce a separate ranking of the factors, as presented in Table 4. From this, Kendall’s coef cient of concordance W was computed using the formula (Siegel, 1956):
W 5 k2(N3 2 N)/12	(2) where s is the sum of squares of deviation of ranking sum from mean, k is the number of respondent groups (two in this case), and N is the number of factors or entities (12 in this case). Table 5 presents the evaluation of Kendall’s concordance coef cient between the engineers’ and the contractors’ rankings. From the table, Kendall’s coef cient of concordance W obtained is 0.78. A coef cient of 0.63 is considered as a moderately high degree of concordance between the sets of ranking (Hays, 1998). Nevertheless, the value of W must also be investigated for signi cance, to ensure that the agreement between the two rankings (the engineers’ and the contractors’) were not as a result of pure chance. For this the chi-squared test was used in determining the probability of occurrence of a relationship between the two sets of rankings.
With a concordance coef cient W of 0.78, the chisquared value obtained was 17.21, for 11 degrees of freedom. Reading from percentage points of the chisquare distribution, the null hypothesis that ‘there is no relationship between the sets of ranks’ has a probability of occurrence of p < 10%. The alternative hypothesis can therefore be accepted at the 90% con dence level, assuring that agreement among the differing group of respondents was higher than it would be by chance.

4 Thus we may conclude that the ranking obtained for 5 all the 41 respondents, as given by the severity index 6 analysis, was consensual among the respondents, 7 signi cant and coherent, and therefore may be used 8 for research.
3 The statistical analysis carried out has systematically 4 ranked a list of 12 construction related factors 5 perceived by industry professionals as being important 6 in in uencing the choice of  oor system. The ranking 7 obtained (Table 3) was as a result of a consensual 8 agreement among the respondents, as con rmed by the 9 concordance test. A visual inspection of the ratings also 4011shows that none of the respondents had used the same 1 rating for all the factors throughout, implying that 2 thoughtful consideration had been given to the ques3 tionnaire.
4 ‘Appropriateness of use’, as expected, was ranked 5 highest, indicating the utmost importance of choosing 6 the right kind of  oor system to suit a given situation. ‘Cost’, which has been and will continue to be a major objective for any engineering decision, was perceived to be the second most important factor for the selection of a  oor system. This is followed by ‘constructability’ and ‘speed’, but judging from their severity indices, the percentage differences between ‘cost’, ‘constructability’ and ‘speed’ are very small (less than 2%, measured relative to the higher ranked factor). Thus, one could perhaps give them equal importance. All the above four factors are among the important issues raised in his report by Egan (1998), who called for improved competitiveness, better value for money and predictability in UK construction projects. The fact that the survey was conducted after that report was published might indicate a positive reaction towards the report by the respondents, and therefore is thought to be the underlying reason for the choice of the above factors. This may be con rmed by looking at the position of ‘health and safety’, another important but relatively new issue raised in the report, as the  fth most salient factor in uencing the choice of a  oor system.
Professional background and training may also have an in uence on the selection of the factors. Although, as a whole, UK engineers and contractors are in good agreement with each other with regard to the ranking of the factors, their opinions somehow contradict each other, particularly on some of the lower ranked factors. For example, considering the rankings in Table 4, contractors do not view ‘health and safety’ in  oor construction with the same degree of importance as do engineers, a situation that can be a cause for concern for the industry. In addition, contractors (in the survey, frame contractors) also pay less attention to the importance of ef ciency of  oor systems in accommodating service ducts. This may be because they do not see the importance of this issue in design as much as the engineers, or because they may think that this is a problem for the structural or mechanical and electrical engineers. Engineers, on the other hand, perceive ‘familiarity’ to be less important in in uencing the choice of a  oor system when compared with contractors. Making decisions based on familiarity and personal preferences is perhaps something engineers are quite reluctant to admit, even though in reality this has been known to be a common practice.
Rather surprisingly, ‘quality of  nished concrete’ is not ranked highly by the respondents (ranked 8th out of 12). The engineers’ and contractors’ rankings for this factor (Table 4) show that engineers and contractors have the same view on its importance. A possible reason for this is that quality, though very important in  oor construction, is more a function of workmanship and material speci cation, rather than the type of system chosen. Besides, this low ranking could also be attributed to the increased use of false ceilings and raised  oors in modern buildings, as commented by some of the respondents.
It is also interesting to note that labour dependence causes much less concern to the industry (ranked 11th out of 12). This can be an indication that construction labour in the UK is still abundant.
As in any research work based on surveys, the study is subject to certain biases and limitations. Firstly, the assessment of the factors was restricted to those stated in the questionnaire. Although respondents were encouraged to add their own, these could not be added to the original list because only a few of them did so and each gave a different one. Secondly, the engineers were chosen from the private (consultant) sector only. Public sector engineers such as those in local authorities should have been included in the sampling list, as some of their projects are designed ‘in-house’. Finally, this study is limited to investigating construction related factors only. In practice, the choice of the  oor systems will also be in uenced by factors from other categories, such as structural, architectural, services or operational, depending on the emphasis placed in the selection.
Despite the above limitations, the authors are of the opinion that the factors in ranking order obtained from this study adequately represent the views of the construction industry with regard to the construction related factors affecting the choice of  oor or similar structural systems. The rank ordering of the salient factors (appropriateness of use, cost, constructability, speed, and health and safety) can help those engineers in the industry involved in the development of procedures or computer-based tools for the evaluation and selection of  oor and other structural systems. They are able to prioritize the criteria that should be taken as the basis of evaluation and selection by their system and, consequently, determine the data to be collected.
Researchers and design engineers working towards developing new and more ef cient  oor systems, such as those in the precast manufacturing sector of the industry, should also  nd the factors useful. The factors would give them a good indication of the needs and priorities of their ‘customers’ (i.e. the decisionmakers of  oor systems). By focusing their inventions according to the factors, not only would they receive wider acceptance of their products in the market but also they would improve the availability of construction-ef cient and higher quality structural components. With wider and more frequent use of such systems, it is envisaged that the overall performance of UK construction projects and therefore the overall productivity in the UK construction industry could be improved, in line with the Egan aspirations.

Following a literature review on methods of assessing and selecting  oor systems, 12 factors were identi ed as being directly related to the construction process. A structured questionnaire survey was conducted within the UK construction industry to obtain data on the perceived importance of these factors with regard to the choice of a concrete  oor system. A non-parametric method was used to analyse the data and from this, and a consensual ranking of the factors was produced.
The ranking shows that ‘appropriateness of use’ is perceived to be the principal selection factor, followed by, in order of importance, ‘cost’, ‘constructability’, ‘speed’ and ‘health and safety’, i.e.  ve factors that seem to re ect current industry emphasis. These  ve factors may be adopted as the criteria for evaluating and selecting concrete  oor systems during the design stage. In addition, they may be used as criteria for the development of future improved  oor systems.
The authors would like to thank all the organizations that had spent their valuable time to complete and return the questionnaire. Without their co-operation, this research would not have been possible.
