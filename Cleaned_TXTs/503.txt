In search of ‘project chemistry’
1	Received 10 May 2001; accepted 1 October 2001
6	The paper aims to provide a language and a conceptual toolkit to deepen our understanding of the impact 7	of relational and social issues on the success of construction projects. Building on several streams of litera-
8 ture, as well as on individual and group interviews with construction practitioners, the paper develops the notion of ‘project chemistry’ as a way of capturing some of the relational and behavioural dimensions and 9 factors that may affect project success and effectiveness in construction. The paper introduces a provisional 2011 theoretical framework that (a) identi es a number of external and project level determinants of ‘project chem1 istry’, (b) suggests ways of measuring how and how well people interact, perceive, and work together in a 2 project, and (c) relates these issues to broader economic and technical factors. The paper concludes with 3 some re ections on the implications and challenges for future research and management practices raised by 4 the notion of ‘project chemistry’.
Introduction
The importance of interpersonal relations, team spirit and collaboration is a recurring theme in construction management. The take up of innovative procurement and business practices such as partnering, lean construction and supply chain management require the adoption of non-confrontational attitudes, a collaborative spirit, and trust that, in turn, highlight the importance of social, human and cultural factors in the management of construction organizations and projects (Akintoye et al., 2000). However, in spite of the increased recognition of the importance of ‘soft’ management factors in construction management, practitioners (and sometimes researchers as well) often lack the necessary language and conceptual tools to make sense of and effectively address these issues.
The present paper constitutes an attempt to  ll such a gap. It proposes the use of the notion of ‘project chemistry’ as a way of deepening our understanding
of the relational dimensions and factors that may lead to successful project performance.
Historically the notion of ‘good chemistry’ between people has a very ancient and prestigious pedigree. The images of chemistry and af nity were in fact in common use before the advent of scienti c psychology in the early 1800s to explain sympathies and aversions between people and groups, and they have been used ever since with this meaning.
The term ‘good project chemistry’ is particularly attractive in our context for it seems to capture a quality of the interaction between people on a project, based on an af nity of intents and dispositions, i.e. an intangible characteristic of interaction that many have posited as the basis of, for example, successful partnering.
Although the notion of ‘project chemistry’ may be useful as a metaphor to highlight a particular aspect of business and work practices, there are some inherent risks as well, in that the notion may quickly become a sort of black box term (like ‘culture’) that hampers our comprehension of project processes instead of making

them more comprehensible. Thus in order to exploit the heuristic potential of the term we need to investigate what sorts of things may be encapsulated by the expression ‘project chemistry’, how it relates to other aspects of work life and work practices, and what role it plays in project success. The paper aims to take a
 rst step in this direction. Building on the existing liter8 ature on organizational climate, cross-functional team 9 effectiveness and behavioural aspects of project 1011 management, as well as on a series of focus groups 1 and interviews with construction practitioners, the 2 paper develops a provisional theoretical framework of 3 what ‘project chemistry’ as metaphor or expression 4 may refer to, its antecedents and the ways in which it 5 affects project outcomes.
6 It is important to emphasize that the main purpose 7 of this work is not to provide de nitive answers or to 8 propose prescriptive models, as much as (a) to raise 9 awareness in the construction management research 2011 community about the impact of human issues on 1 projects and how these issues interact with broader 2 economical and technical factors; and (b) to develop 3 a language and a conceptual toolkit for thinking 4 through these complex phenomena. It should not come 5 as a surprise, then, that the paper raises at least as 6 many issues as it solves, and that the proposed model 7 captures only some of the issues at stake.
3011	The contribution of the literature to our
1	understanding of ‘project chemistry’
3 Three bodies of literature appear particularly useful to 4 help articulate the notion of ‘project chemistry’: on 5 organizational and team climate, on success factors in 6 cross-functional teamwork in new product develop7 ment, and the project management literature on social 8 determinants of project effectiveness.
‘Project chemistry’ and the study of
1 organizational and team climates
3 Interest in social and affective atmospheres in organi4 zations and their link to performance has been pursued 5 for several decades under the heading of organizational
6 climate, which has been de ned as ‘a relatively enduring characteristic of an organization that distinguishes it from other organizations and: (a) embodies members’ collective perceptions about their organizations with respect to such dimensions as autonomy, trust, cohesiveness, support, recognition innovation, and fairness; (b) is produced by members’ interaction; (c) serves as a basis for interpreting the situation; (d) re ects the prevalent norms, values and attitudes of the organization’s culture; and (e) acts as a source of
in uence for shaping behaviour (Moran and Volkwein, 1992, p. 20).
Following the pioneering work of the social psychologist Kurt Lewin, who in the 1940s started to investigate the effects of what he called ‘social climate’ on the behaviour of individuals in groups and organizations, the topic has been at the centre of the interest of the organizational studies community for several decades (Lewin, 1948, 1951; Littwin and Stringer, 1968; Tagiuri et al., 1968; Schneider, 1975; Schneider and Snyder, 1975; Joyce and Slocum, 1982; Glick, 1985; Reichers and Schneider, 1990; Moran and Volkwein, 1992).
Scholars studying the phenomenon of organizational climate have proposed three alternative notions of its nature and origin: as an attribute of an organization, as the shared perceptions of members, and as the perception managers have of their organization.
A  rst group of scholars argues that the organizational climate is a characteristic or an attribute belonging to an organization. It forms because members are exposed to common structural characteristics, such as the size of organization, the degree of centralization of decision-making, the number of levels of hierarchy, the nature of the technology employed, and the extent to which formal rules and policies proscribe individual behaviour (Littwin and Stringer, 1968; Tagiuri et al., 1968).
Another group of scholars takes a different view, and focuses more on the individuals and their perceptions. These scholars take the climate as a result of people interacting with each other in response to the organizational situations; more precisely, climate is the shared implications of organizational policies, practices and procedure (Reichers and Schneider, 1990, p.22).
Finally, a further group of scholars describes climate as the perception managers have of the characteristic and the way of functioning of their organization. They emphasize the role of the leadership in shaping the organizational climate through the organizational structure they set up, the way they reward people, and how they recruit and promote members. Thus there are several possible climates conducive to success, and the task of managers is to ensure that the organizational ethos is communicated properly, so that the organizational climate is aligned with the strategic direction set by the top management.
In recent years authors have taken a more sceptical view of the concept of organizational climate and pointed out, for example, that speaking about climate does not really make sense unless one speci es a referent for the notion (e.g. climate for change, etc.). If we do not know what the climate is for, it is almost impossible to test the correlation between climate and organizational performance (Schneider and Reichers, 1983). As a consequence, researchers have started to direct their attention to investigating the conditions conducive to particular climates, especially those for innovation and for safety, focusing especially on small group and team levels.
For example, Anderson and West (1996, 1998) developed a useful model of team climate and a related tool 8 named ‘team climate inventory’. The model applies at 9 work group level, understood as ‘the permanent or semi1011 permanent team to which individuals are assigned, with 1 whom they identify, and with whom they interact regu2 larly in order to perform work related tasks’ (Anderson 3 and West, 1998, p. 236). It describes and measures the 4 climate for innovation in work groups along the follow5 ing  ve main dimensions: (1) level of shared vision and 6 clarity of goals; (2) perception of a safety and non7 threatening environment that encourages participation
8 in decision-making; (3) presence of a task orientation 9 and a commitment to excellence coupled with continu2011 ous improvement procedures and practices; (4) support 1 and reward for innovation; and (5) level of communica2 tion and interaction between team members.
3 In summary, the long lasting interest in organiza4 tional and group climate provides some valuable
5 insights into understanding ‘project chemistry’.
6  rst place, ‘project chemistry’ is likely to be an outcome
7 of a number of factors of diverse nature, some speci c
8 to the project level, and others deriving from the orga-
9 nizations involved in the project and the broader busi3011 ness environment. One should resist the temptation to 1 focus on HR practices only, and the effects of ‘hard’ 2 technological processes or commercial practices should 3 also be taken into consideration. Second, project 4 management styles, practices and procedures are likely 5 to have a considerable impact. Finally, the notion of 6 ‘project chemistry’ overlaps, at least in part, with that 7 of climate and in particular with that of team climate. 8 Some of the factors identi ed by Anderson and West 9 could therefore be usefully extended to capture aspects 4011 of what we call here ‘project chemistry’.
Project chemistry and the study of
3 cross-functional teamwork in new product
6 Cross-functional teams are de ned in management studies as teams in which members of different departments and disciplines are brought together under one manager and charged with making development decisions and enlisting support for them throughout the organization in order to ensure the effective delivery of a common organizational objective (Ancona and Caldwell, 1992; Holland et al., 2000).
Unlike in construction, where cross-functional project teams have been the norm for a long time (Cherns and Bryant, 1984), in manufacturing the use of cross-functional teams in product development constitutes a relatively recent innovation. It was not until the beginning of the 1980s that cross-functional teams became common practice in innovative product development, although in recent years their diffusion has become widespread and they are currently used by over 84% of US  rms (Grif n, 1997).
Given their wide diffusion and critical importance, in recent years cross-functional teams, and the factors affecting their performance, have attracted increasing attention from organizational and management researchers (Stein, 1982; Pinto et al., 1993; Ancona and Caldwell, 1992; Holland et al., 2000). Extensive research on the topic has found that  ve factors are critical for the success and superior performance of cross-functional teams: task design, group composition, organizational context, internal processes and boundary management, and group psychosocial traits (Holland et al., 2000). These results are summarized in Table 1.
The body of research on success factors in crossfunctional teamwork in new product development con rms and expands the insights derived from the study of organizational and team climate. In particular: (a) cross-functional teams are more likely to succeed where there is strategic alignment between functions, a culture that prizes participative teamwork and an organizational focus on supporting team and project needs as well as rewarding team level efforts and achievements; (b) in order for teams to obtain a high level of trust and cohesiveness, appropriate action needs to be taken so that the design, group selection and formation processes, management style and practices, reward and recognition principles, communication mechanism and systems are all aligned. In short, successful cross-functional teams thrive in organizations that value them, recognize their importance and provide the necessary support and assistance.
Project chemistry and the study of social determinants of project effectiveness in project management literature
Contrary to the substantial attention devoted by organization theory and occupational psychology to the study of human, cultural and psychological factors, these issues still attract relatively little attention in the construction literature. As a consequence, in spite of the burgeoning literature on project success (how to measure it, how to achieve it), we still know very little about the relations between human factors and project outcome.
Furthermore, as noted by Bleout (1998), even in the broader project management community, often the impact of ‘human factors’ is addressed at a very high

4 level, e.g. utilizing traditional human resource manage5 ment categories (e.g. staf ng and recruitment at the 6 organization level, employee assistance and informa-
8 equal pay policy, sanctions, administrative services, 9 etc.) that fail to capture the critical success factors of 4011 different project management practices.
1 Among the few studies explicitly addressing the 2 social and psychological aspects of project management 3 is the work of Boddy and Buchanan (1992). These 4 authors take an unusual approach in that they address 5 project management as an instance of management of
6 change, assuming that most ‘projects’ will have as a major aim the production of signi cant modi cations in the task, structure, and technology of people in an organization. Although their work is not always based on rigorous research (the data are derived from eight diaries kept by project managers, and no details on the treatment are provided), and the results are presented in a prescriptive manner, their tenets are not too dissimilar to those emerging from the literature on organizational climates and cross-functional teams in manufacturing. According to Boddy and Buchanan (1992, Chapters 5–8), project managers are mainly in the business of in uencing all the stakeholders that have an interest in the project. In particular, they state that project managers need to in uence their project team and staff by providing a focus, choosing the right people, negotiating time, making the most of diversity, building relationships and sustaining momentum during dif cult times; also they need to manage across other departments and organizations, negotiating the necessary resources and support and creating a sense of collective ownership; and PMs need to manage up, that is, in uence senior executives or founders by creating and selling the vision, communicating results and recognizing danger signals.
The project management literature offers some interesting insights into the mechanisms through which a ‘project chemistry’ can contribute to project success or failure especially in construction. Loosemore (1998), for example, studied the reaction of construction teams during project crises. He found that serious project crises affect the pattern of relationships between members and generate three ironies: at a time when effective communication is important, it is less likely; at a time when mutual sensitivity between team members is important, it is less likely; and at a time when collective responsibility and teamwork are important, they are less likely. He concludes that crises put serious strains on projects, and they can represent 8 either opportunities for increased team cohesion and
9 collaboration or a potential cause of division and 1011 con ict. From our perspective, a good ‘project chem1 istry’, supported by the necessary organizational 2 processes, can at this juncture make the difference 3 between a gleaming success and a serious failure.
4 In conclusion, the project management literature on 5 social determinants of projects indicates primarily that 6 there is a need for more research focusing on micro7 level social and human processes and their relations to 8 organization-wide HR practices. It also suggests that 9 ‘project chemistry’ may have different effects at 2011 different stages of a project and, by extension, that the 1 same type of chemistry, i.e. the same combination of 2 factors, may not always deliver superior project team 3 performance and project success.
6	Building theory from the bottom up:
7	practitioners say
9 As already noted, most of the literature on team climate 3011 and critical success factors for cross-functional teams 1 and even project management derives from sectors other 2 than construction. Such literature is therefore extremely
3 helpful in pinpointing a range of general factors, but by 4 its nature it cannot help us identify speci c conditions 5 and factors that affect the success of projects in con6 struction. Although the similarities between the task of 7 cross-functional teams in new product development and 8 construction project teams suggest that some of the  nd9 ings could be transferred between the two areas of study, 4011 this may not be enough to develop a meaningful and 1 usable framework for construction.
2 Accordingly, in order to produce a model of ‘project 3 chemistry’ suited to the conditions and domain speci4  city of the construction industry, I decided to support 5 the theory-building effort with some qualitative  eld
6 work aimed at eliciting practitioners’ views of ‘project chemistry’ and the factors affecting it. I wanted to integrate my traditional ‘top down’ strategy of theory building based on the literature review and personal re ection with a ‘bottom up’ effort based on the distillation of practitioners’ experience. The purpose was to establish how practitioners make sense of these phenomena so that their grounded categorization could be taken into account during the theory-building effort to create a model that would speak not only to the
research community (as would be one built on only the results of previous research) but also to ‘re ective’ practitioners as well.
To achieve this aim, during the project I conducted two focus group interviews and a number of individual semi-structured interviews with members of demonstration projects of the Movement for Innovation Initiative (M4I).
The focus group method is an established rigorous technique for collective interviews aimed at eliciting and exploring in-depth opinions, judgements and evaluations expressed by professionals, experts or users/clients about speci c topics (Morgan, 1997). The two focus groups in the present research were facilitated by the author and lasted about 90 minutes each. Prospective participants were sent a brief description of the project together with a short note explaining the mechanics of the focus groups. Overall, 17 people accepted the invitation and participated in the two groups. Interviewees belonged to different professional groups (architects and other designers, project managers, human resource managers, corporate managers, client project sponsors), and came from a variety of industry segments (public sector, private sector owner-occupier building, private sector building for a developer). The two collective interviews were conducted separately using the same schedule. Questions discussed included how to describe and recognize project chemistry, what factors affect it, and concrete ways in which chemistry could affect the outcome of a project.
It is important to note that the focus groups were not intended as a survey, and their results should not be construed as such. In our context they were used to enrich the comprehension of what may count as ‘project chemistry’, how it is achieved and how it may affect project outcome. Therefore they cannot be construed as a reliable sample of the view of the UK construction industry. By the same token, the two group interviews helped us identify initiatives currently being carried out or planned in the industry, but they do not tell us how common they are or how they affect projects.
The two focus groups were integrated by seven individual interviews with expert project managers and construction practitioners. The semi-structured interviews were carried out face-to-face or by telephone, and used the same schedule as the focus groups.
Data from the focus groups and the other interviews were transcribed verbatim and their content was analysed with the (limited, given the small amount of transcribed material) support of ‘Nudist’, a computerized qualitative data analysis tool.
In the following section, I summarize the  ndings of allinterviews. Theindented text in smallertype hasbeen taken from the verbatim transcription of the interviews.
What is captured by the idea of ‘project chemistry’?
In the  rst place, participants indicated that at the simplest level the expression simply captures the idea that people in the team get along.
Upon closer scrutiny, however, the term appears to have several dimensions. According to participants, 8 ‘project chemistry’ can be used to capture two different 9 aspects: speci c behaviour and perceptions of the team 1011 by members. Participants tended to associate good 1 project chemistry with good and open communication,
2	collaboration between members and integration:
4 . . . a team where you can really  re ideas that bounce

6 Others associated the term more with members’ 7 perceptions of the group climate, especially in terms 8 of shared goals, psychological safety and care:
9 . . . there are no territories and I think nobody is 2011 precious about it, and so it is all expansive: everybody 1 can tread wherever they like including the client, and 2 I think that’s an essential component . . . people care 3 about how other people  t . . .
4 In general, participants agreed that the term captures 5 an important dimension of the work environment and 6 that ‘project chemistry’ should not be confused with 7 friendship or ‘cosiness’, for the latter may in fact be 8 detrimental to project success.
9 If the relationship is to live beyond the immediate then 3011 there have to be also some long term goals, business 1 rewards or others, rather than just friendship, because 2 I can go to the cricket club for friendship, or I can 3 seek that deeper spiritual thing from other sources.
5	How do you achieve good ‘project chemistry’?
7 An issue raised at the beginning of the interview was
8 ‘who’s chemistry are we talking about’? There was 9 recognition that a climate of collaboration should be 4011 achieved throughout the entire project community.
1 However, there was also a consensus that the initial focus should be on the small core project group.
2 core project group establishes a good chemistry, then
it is much easier to cascade it to others and to those
4	coming on board at later stages:
6	We should focus on project teams and then . . .
mean it in a hierarchical sense but then it  lters down to the troops
Such a ‘core team  rst’ approach, of course, renders the selection process all the more important:
. . . the same selection process should run right the way through . . . and I think you have to select everybody, wherever they are in the chain, on very similar criteria, and particularly that key objective to work together as a team and make a contribution as a team member
Re ecting on their experience, participants also identi ed a number of conditions and initiatives that are conducive to good project chemistry for both the core team and the rest of the project community.
These conditions and initiatives fall within  ve main categories: commercial and business practices and task design, team selection and composition, management of team development processes, quality of leadership, and initiatives to sustain involvement,
Commercial and business practices and task design.
Participants generally agreed that the quality of ‘project chemistry’ was enhanced when the commercial relationship established between the organizations involved in the project enabled collaboration within the project community. This included obtaining client support and involvement and adopting the appropriate contractual relations (partnering of some kind), and possibly con guring the project as a sort of virtual organization with which all members of the community can identify. Participants also noted that the way in which the design and construction process is organized constitutes a condition that affects the emergence of ‘good project chemistry’. For example, the early involvement of suppliers in the design process, the use of gateways, periodic project reviews both at the whole community level and on a daily basis (e.g. site level short meetings to review work and plan next steps) and co-location were all mentioned as factors affecting ‘project chemistry’. Finally, participants noted that the roots of ‘bad project chemistry’ might at times be deeply ingrained in the ways people are trained to behave. In many a way, participants recognize that the reluctance shown by certain persons in construction to work as a team goes back to the way they were trained in their professional trades.
Team selection and composition
A factor often mentioned as critical is selecting the right people for the job, for example using psychological pro ling methods to try to select team members on the basis of compatibility of personalities. Several participants also noted that retaining the same team throughout a project and allowing for repeat collaboration of the same team across several projects helps to capitalize on the time, effort and resources invested. It was also emphasized that accuracy of selection should not be limited to the selection of the core project team but should be carried out for all key project actors coming on board later. In particular, they suggested that the extension of the original project team should be based on proved compatibility, and that all newcomers to the project community should be systematically and thoroughly induced.
Quality of leadership
Several participants recognized quality of leadership as a critical factor in achieving good ‘project chemistry’:
Project chemistry almost is dictated by the way the project is led
It was noted that it would be extremely helpful if 8 construction team leaders and project managers 9 received some form of training and mentoring on how
1011	to develop and manage good group relationships.
2 Management of team development processes
3 Many of the respondents agreed that once the team 4 has been selected and the leader chosen it is impor-
5 tant to put in place formalized team building activities
6 and workshops:
Set up a core team and send them away for a couple of
8	days in a hotel so that they can bond between themselves 9
2011 Many participants reported that holding an initial 1 professionally facilitated workshop gives a team the 2 right start, and enhances the likelihood of developing 3 good ‘project chemistry’. The workshop constitutes an 4 opportunity to re ne, so to speak, the composition of 5 the group by testing their capacity to work together in 6 practice; it also allows the team to develop another
7 fundamental ingredient of ‘project chemistry’, i.e. clear 8 explicit rules and goals. It also facilitates the planning, 9 deployment and review of good communication prac3011 tices at all levels and all of the time.
1 A key aspect of the team development process is the 2 establishment of measurement and feedback process, 3 focused on both goals and relations.
5 Initiatives to sustain involvement and well being of all
7 Observing the impact of this kind on activity on 8 ‘project chemistry’, participants mentioned whole 9 project and whole supply chain social events, estab4011 lishing and maintaining high professional standards on 1 site (security, access, health and safety), and providing 2 good facilities (WC, shower, canteen). Clear commu3 nication right through the levels, using boards, project 4 gadgets and logos, internal bulletins, short meeting and 5 presentations, was also mentioned as an important way 6 to involve all members of the project community.
How does good ‘project chemistry’ affects the outcome of a project?
The results of the analysis of the focus group and individual interviews indicated an emerging pattern of relations between ‘project chemistry’ and project outcomes.
In the  rst place, good ‘project chemistry’ enhances the quality of the  nal product by harvesting expertise and creativity from all team members. It also reduces time, for it allows the early detection of potential problems and an improved problem-solving process. Second, good ‘project chemistry’ constitutes a motivator and helps people working in the same direction:
. . . you work more cooperatively and easily together . . . no need to struggle with external in uences affecting the project
Also it allows more productive use of resources, less defensive bureaucracy and use of time, and less paperwork.
Overall, participants in the two focus groups and individual interviews agreed that ‘project chemistry’ is something special that happens when the right people and the right conditions apply:
I think good chemistry actually binds together . . . we’re talking about a chemical reaction where elements bind together, fuse together and in that process then . . . people feel so secure and able to contribute.
However, ‘chemistry’ is not only being friends. Although friendliness is an important aspect of ‘good project chemistry’, it does not imply respect, or capacity to listen and to disagree while working towards a common goal.
A provisional theoretical framework for understanding ‘project chemistry’ and its implications for project performance
The results of our two focus groups are very much aligned with the available literature. Together they provide support for the idea that ‘project chemistry’ may be a useful term to embrace how and how well people interact, perceive each other and work together in the project. On the basis of the literature and the ‘grounded’ categories emerging from the focus groups analysis, it is possible to hypothesize both the antecedents, process and immediate outcomes of such processes of interaction and perception, as well as to advance some hypotheses on the mechanisms through which this may impact the outcome of a project. These hypotheses are summarized in the model presented in Figure 1.
The model suggests  rst that ‘project chemistry’ depends on two types of antecedent factor: factors deriving from the organizations involved in the project (and from the broader business environment through them) and factors speci c to the project and its individual members.
1	Figure 1	Provisional model of ‘project chemistry’ and its effects on project performance
The antecedent factors deriving from the organizations involved in the project and from the broader 2
4 business environment through them include: (1) com5 mercial and business relations, e.g. client support and
6 involvement and collaborative contractual relations;
7 (2) the design and construction process, i.e. structured 8 early involvement of suppliers in the design and plan9 ning process, use of a formalized gateway-based project
4011	process, use of participative decision-making tech-
1 niques such as value and risk management, and peri2 odic project reviews both at the whole community and 3 site level; (3) human resource management policies of
4 the organizations involved in the project, included here
5 because of their effect on selections, reward structure
6 and training at project level; and (4) wider industry rules of appropriateness on how to relate at project level learned during instruction and professional training and to be taken into consideration as they are carried into the project by individual ‘carriers’, to borrow an expression from Max Weber.
It is worth noting here that, by pointing to these factors as antecedent of ‘project chemistry, I am in fact suggesting that although ‘project chemistry’ refers to the emotional, perceptual and psychological consequences of communication and interaction, its emergence is likely to be affected by ‘hard’ aspects such as the existing technological processes and commercial practices that lie mainly beyond the reach of the project team members.
The emergence of ‘project chemistry’ is also likely to depend on the establishment of a number of conditions and identi able project level practices. Probably these will fall within the following categories: team selection and composition, team development process, quality of leadership, boundary management and empowerment of team, and involvement and well being of whole project community. They constitute project level determinants of ‘project chemistry’. Table 2 summarizes a way of operationalizing these  ve factors along a number of dimensions.
Because the notion of project chemistry as described here overlaps, at least in part, with that of team climate for innovation, some of its features could be provisionally colllected and measured along three of the four dimensions of the Anderson and West TCI model (Anderson and West, 1996, 1998), e.g. clarity and level

3 Finally, my model hypothesizes that ‘project chem4 istry’ affects overall project performance in two ways: 5 by generating speci c social outcomes and by affecting 6 the way in which the task is performed. In other words, 7 ‘project chemistry’ is likely to produce some interme8 diate social and task-related outcomes that are in fact 9 the medium through which ‘project chemistry’ affects 4011 overall project success. A project with good chemistry 1 is likely to have close social relations between team 2 members, a friendly and open environment, a low level 3 of con ict, high motivation, a focused team, and high 4 morale and team dedication. Some or all these features 5 are likely to be found lacking in a project with ‘poor
6 project chemistry’. Social outcomes constitute a significant project result on their own merit, given that, as noted by participants in the focus groups, a project in which good technical or  nancial outcomes are obtained at the expense of human and professional relations is a false success.
‘Project chemistry’ is also likely to produce outcomes that are directly related to the performance of the speci c tasks at hand, such as adoption of innovative design and building solutions, reduction of waste, improved ef ciency and costs of quality or of litigation. Social and task related outcomes of good ‘project chemistry’ are summarized in Table 3.
Finally, it is an assumption of this study that through these social and task related outcomes good ‘project chemistry’ will impact positively on the outcome of a project. However, it is worth emphasizing that, as Özçelik et al. (2000) recently reiterated, the latter relation is far from established, and should be tested in the context of the overall model.
Conclusion and directions of future research
The present study constituted an exploration of the notion of ‘project chemistry’ and how it may effect project performance. My research resulted in a provisional theoretical framework to identify a number of dimensions to make sense of ‘project chemistry’, as well as a host of factors that may affect it and ways in which it, in turn, can affect overall project success. In particular, the framework suggests that ‘project chemistry’ should not be thought of as a characteristic of the people involved as much as a trait of the relations between people, task and organizational conditions. Thus, ‘project chemistry’ is a process that needs

6 The  ndings of this research hold signi cant impli-
7 cations for future research, and provide some provi8 sional indication on how such research could bene t 9 the construction business community.
3011 In the  rst place, the model needs to be tested to 1 ascertain which of the described relations are signi 2 cant or which of the factors have more impact on 3 project performance. As mentioned above, the study
4 was aimed at theory building, and the methodology 5 utilized does not permit the drawing of any conclu-
Corroborating the model will therefore neces7 sarily be the aim of a future study. It is worth noting, 8 however, that the hypothesis that good ‘project chem9 istry’ has an impact on project performance builds on 4011 the extensive research that demonstrated a relation 1 between group effectiveness and group performance 2 (see Cohen and Bailey (1997) for an extensive review). 3 The model also raises some interesting issues for 4 further research. For example, is ‘project chemistry’ an 5 enabler or an enhancer of project success?
6 words, is ‘project chemistry’ a necessary basic condition without which project success cannot be obtained, but that in itself cannot guarantee project success? Or is it a characteristic that relates directly to project performance? Are degrees of ‘project chemistry’ correlated with degrees of success or is there a threshold below which outstanding project results will not be achieved? Are all the factors of equal importance? Can one aspect compensate for another ‘poorer’ one?
the three dimensions of the TCI model good enough to capture the critical aspects of team level interaction and perception?
It is clear that any future attempts to test the validity of the model will have to wrestle with the challenge of measuring project success in order to measure the relationships between the variables. Although this issue is quite complex and has proved highly elusive, several studies in construction and in other sectors have proposed promising models and metrics (Freeman and Beale, 1992; Shenhar, 1997; Liu, 1998).
Although a lot of work remains to be done, the identi cation of which of the practices and factors in the framework bear what consequence on project performance would provide invaluable information to construction organizations and project managers. Certainly, the model indicates speci c areas of skill and competence that could become speci c targets of training and development, as well as criteria for selection and performance evaluation.
If corroborated, the model could also help direct the attention and optimize the efforts of construction managers to improve project effectiveness. For example, the model hypothesises that both hard (business, technological and commercial processes) and soft (human relations and HRM) factors are involved in producing ‘project chemistry’ and especially good ‘project chemistry’. This tenet suggests that attempting to improve project effectiveness by focusing on soft issues only, without making any progress on the hard ones, may be fruitless. This is likely to have an impact on the strategies used to increase ef ciency and productivity. At the same time, if corroborated, the model would make a case for speci c and well thought out ‘project level’ human resource policies, initiatives and investments to produce consistent high performance at the project level in the construction industry.
