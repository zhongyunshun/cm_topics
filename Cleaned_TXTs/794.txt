The construction industry plays a pivotal role in social, economic, and environmental development. However, the industry's unsustainable development has caused various environmental issues, and one of the most significant problems is construction waste. In Malaysia, construction waste constitutes a substantial portion of solid waste each year, most of which ends up in landfills without proper treatment, leading to further environmental issues. Construction activities have also resulted in environmental problems such as water, air, and noise pollution in the country. Furthermore, the use of conventional construction materials in the country contributes to the industry's unsustainable development. Conventional concrete is the most commonly used construction material, generating the most construction waste in a construction project. The production of conventional concrete emits a massive amount of carbon dioxide (CO2) due to the use of cement, accounting for 8% to 10% of global anthropogenic CO2 emissions annually. Therefore, implementing environmental management practices and using green materials can be key factors in achieving sustainable development in the Malaysian construction industry.

utilized in the industry. Environmental management refers to a management system that enables organizations to reduce their environmental impact. In the construction industry, environmental management can help minimize environmental impacts in four generic areas: resource consumption, emissions, solid waste, interface with the external environment, and intrinsic quality of the construction site [2, 3]. Green materials are construction materials related to resource and energy efficiency in the manufacturing process. These materials should pollute less to the environment and have no negative impact on human health. One potential green material in the market is green concrete, which can reduce 70% or more of the global warming potential of conventional concrete [4, 5]. The aim of this study is to provide an overview of the current status of environmental management practices and the utilization of green materials for construction in Malaysia. Additionally, it aims to discuss the prospects and challenges of environmental management practices and the utilization of green materials in the country.
Current Status of Construction Industry in Malaysia
The construction industry has played a significant role in the economy of Malaysia. From 1991 to 2010, it contributed an average of 4.09% to the country's GDP and an average of 8.56% to the total national workforce [6]. Some iconic constructions, such as the Petronas Twin Towers, the world's tallest building from 1998 to 2004, and the Kuala Lumpur International Airport, which was named one of the best airports in the Airport Service Quality (ASQ) survey for 2022, have not only brought economic benefits but also international recognition and fame to Malaysia. Furthermore, recent projections suggest that the Malaysian construction industry will grow by 16.5% in 2022 [7].
Environmental management practices for construction industry in Malaysia.
The construction industry in Malaysia has a significant impact on the environment through the generation of waste, soil erosion, air pollution, and water pollution. To ensure sustainable development, the industry must implement environmental management practices. Environmental management refers to an approach that enables an organization to reduce its environmental impacts. In the construction industry, environmental management can minimize environmental impacts in four generic areas: resource consumption, emissions and solid waste, interface with the external environment, and intrinsic quality of the construction site [3]. To implement environmental management in the construction industry, it is crucial to establish policies and procedures that ensure efficient resource use and waste reduction. This can be achieved through the use of green materials, such as green concrete, which has a lower global warming potential than conventional concrete. Additionally, adopting sustainable construction practices, such as energy-efficient design and construction techniques, can reduce energy consumption and minimize the environmental impacts of construction. In Malaysia, the government has implemented several initiatives to promote sustainable construction practices and environmental management in the construction industry. These initiatives include the Green Building Index (GBI) and the Low Carbon Cities Framework (LCCF), which encourage the use of green materials and sustainable construction practices in building design and construction [8, 9].
Construction waste management.
Construction waste is a significant issue in Malaysia, where it accounts for a large portion of solid waste generated each year (Figure 1). Most of the construction waste ends up in landfills without proper treatment, leading to environmental and health concerns. To address this issue, the Malaysian government has implemented policies and regulations that require construction projects to adhere to waste management guidelines. The Construction Industry Development Board (CIDB) has established a Construction Waste Management Plan (CWMP) to guide construction companies in implementing proper waste management practices. Construction companies are encouraged to practice the 3R concept (reduce, reuse, and recycle) to minimize the amount of waste generated. This includes using prefabricated materials, salvaging materials from demolition sites, and recycling materials such as concrete, wood, and steel. The average amount of construction waste generated from a construction project site is estimated to be around 27,000 tonnes, with concrete and aggregate waste being the highest among all the construction waste generated, accounting for about 65.8% of the total [10]. To reduce waste and environmental impact, the government has encouraged the use of green materials in construction projects. Green concrete, for example, is a potential alternative to conventional concrete that can reduce greenhouse gas emissions by more than 70%.
The composition of generated construction waste materials from a construction project site.
Regulations and legislation aimed at controlling and managing construction waste exist in Malaysia, as shown in Table 1. Landfill disposal and illegal dumping are currently the most common methods for managing construction waste in Malaysia. However, these methods are not environmentally friendly and can cause damage to the environment, unless it is a sanitary landfill. The 3R concept - Reduce, Reuse, and Recycle - is the only environmentally friendly management method. This concept aims to fully utilize resources before they are sent for disposal. Despite the Malaysian government's promotion of the 3R concept, its usage in the country is only 5% [10]. A case study conducted in Penang, Malaysia, on the current practices of the 3R concept among contractors found that weak implementation can be attributed to constraints in time and cost, lack of space, enforcement, awareness and knowledge, coordination, contractors' attitude, and low participation [11].
