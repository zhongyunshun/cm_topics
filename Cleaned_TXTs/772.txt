This study’s integration of academic rigor and detailed analysis aims to foster evidence-based decision making and policy formulation to accelerate the transition toward a low-carbon and environmentally responsible economy.
This study differentiates itself from the existing literature by considering the influence of project stakeholders on project success with the Green Mark. Factors from previous research were compiled into seven categories. The survey includes listed barriers and benefit factors. It was prepared and distributed to many experts in the construction field for ranking. These factors, along with their respective categories, were used to collect perceptions from owners, contractors, and design, supervision, and project management consultants. The analytic hierarchy process (AHP) method quantified the effect of each category on project barriers and benefits. A prioritized list of factors is presented with the support of AHP. This prioritization enables the efficient allocation of limited project resources, leading to more sustainable Green Mark projects in construction projects. The discussion of results will provide recommendations for promoting the construction of more Green Mark-certified buildings.
This research has meticulously reviewed the relevant literature to underscore the research component. In Section 2, a comprehensive analysis of the critical barriers and benefits of implementing the Green Mark program are presented. Furthermore, a research methodology developed specifically for this research is detailed in Section 3. Section 4 showcases the research findings and offers a comparative analysis. The study’s implications and in-depth discussions are expounded upon in Section 5. Finally, the conclusions drawn from the research findings and potential avenues for future research are presented in Section 6.
After conducting a comprehensive review of various factors, a total of thirteen green rating systems spanning continents such as Asia, Europe, North America, Australia, and South Africa were meticulously identified [1], as shown in Table 1.
These systems include renowned frameworks such as BREEAM in the UK, LEED in the US, and Green Mark in Singapore, each offering different certification levels to denote the environmental performance of buildings. Additionally, regional systems like GRIHA in India and LOTUS in Vietnam provide certification levels tailored to their respective contexts. The diversity of these rating systems reflects the global commitment to sustainable building practices and underscores the importance of environmental certification in construction projects worldwide.
