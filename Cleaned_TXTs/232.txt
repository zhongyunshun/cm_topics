As recent buildings have been enlarged and free-formed, it is hard to represent three-dimensional buildings with two -dimensional drawings and identify design errors, construction errors, difference of construction quantity and construction cost, clash with columns, beams, pipe machinery, and so on. In order to overcome the limitations, BIM(Building Information Modeling) has been used in construction industry. However, BIM in the construction site is not fully facilitated after practical implementation in process control including training, evaluation and analysis of the process. Therefore, in this study, the effect of BIM applied in the construction site is analyzed empirically throughout the survey at the construction site in accordance with the training, evaluation, and implementation of BIM.

Effect level of BIM in the last 5 minutes of daily schedule meeting
It has effect and I will extend the time more than
It has effect and I will use the 5 minutes
It has no effect and I will not use the minutes
Effect level of BIM for the site safety management work
It is beneficial to safety management
It is somehow beneficial to safety management but it has shortage
It is not beneficial to safety management
Necessity of extension to the other construction projects such as your project
It is necessary to extend to the other projects
It is necessary to extend to the other projects but the time is not yet ripe for applying
It is not necessary to extend to the other projects
Level of difficulty of BIM education at the site
Not educated
Level of difficulty of self-learning through the supplied BIM textbook
Not educated
