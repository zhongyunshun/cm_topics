Safe and effective construction management requires tools for reducing delays, eliminating reworks, and avoiding accidents. Unfortunately, challenges still exist in current construction practices for enabling real-time interactions among project participants, field discoveries, and massive data. Extended reality (i.e., XR) could help to establish immersive and interactive virtual environments that enable real-time information exchange among humans, cyber processes, and physical environments during construction. However, limited studies have synthesized potentials, challenges, and scenarios of XR for ensuring construction safety and efficiency. This study provides a critical review that synthesizes XR in construction management. First, the authors used the PRISMA method to screen studies related to XR in construction management. Seventy-nine studies were selected and comprehensively analyzed. The authors conducted a bibliometric analysis to comprehend the spatiotemporal distributions of the selected studies. Then, the selected studies were classified into three categories: (1) progress control, (2) quality control, and (3) safety management. The authors also synthesized information for XR applications in various construction management scenarios and summarized the challenges related to XR applications. Finally, this review shed light on future research directions of XR for safe and effective construction management.
virtual reality (VR); augmented reality (AR); mixed reality (MR); construction management
Introduction
Safe and effective construction management is always challenging due to extended construction periods with numerous uncertainties [1]. However, current construction practices could hardly achieve a high level of automation and intelligence, which impede effective and safe construction management processes. For example, time-series sensory data used for quality control and hazard prognosis could hardly be visualized at construction sites. Besides, current safety training programs cannot provide an interactive training environment for workers. Casualties and delays always occur that jeopardize constriction safety and efficiency. It is thus necessary to establish a system that allows real-time visualization and interaction with heterogeneous data and information during tedious construction processes to ensure safe and effective construction management.
Extended reality (XR) represents various immersive technologies that have been developed to improve user experience and enhance their feelings [2]. XR includes virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR), and mixed reality (MR) (the spectrum of VR, AR, and MR is shown in Figure 1). As shown in Figure 1, VR focuses on providing a complete virtual immersive environment that isolates the user from the real world. In contrast, AR and MR aim to blend virtual elements with the real environment. Specifically, AR emphasizes the superposition of virtual elements in the real environment. In contrast, MR could help to blend virtual elements and real environments completely. Through MR, users can interact with elements from both real and virtual environments simultaneously, and elements from the real and virtual environments can also interact [3]. VR has the potential to shield from
on-site hazards and provide immersive and interactive virtual construction environments. AR and MR have the potential to support on-site information retrieval and access and real-time information transfer [4–6]. As proved by many scholars and industry practitioners, XR could be used as a potential tool to improve the information exchange process among humans, cyber processes, and environments during construction management. At present, XR has been preliminarily applied in the progress inspection [6–8], operation instruction [9–11], quality inspection [12,13], hazard identification [14,15], safety education and training [16,17], safety inspection [18–20], and other aspects of the construction site. Based on the above XR use cases, limitations of XR still exist. It is thus necessary to further improve the existing XR-based techniques for supporting effective control of construction progress, quality, and safety. Specifically, the authors have presented a vision of using XR for safe and effective construction management (shown in Figure 2).

A vision of XR for safe and effective construction management.
XR has been extensively examined by various researchers worldwide and has been adopted in many practical scenarios. There are several review studies on the application of XR in the construction engineering and management domain. For example, Cheng et al. [21] summarized the application of AR and MR in the architecture, engineering, construction, and operation (AECO) industry and analyzed the application status of AR/MR according to the stage division. Khan et al. [22] conducted a SWOT analysis to examine the feasibility of integrating XR and building information modeling (BIM) in the architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC) industry. Zhang et al. [22] conducted a bibliometric analysis of XR that summarized seven research hotspots and future research directions. Zhu et al. [23] summarized the latest applications of VR and AR in emergency management scenarios. Li et al. [24] summarized the uses of VR and AR for construction safety. In summary, previous studies have conducted extensive efforts to examine various XR techniques in numerous engineering scenarios. All such efforts have shown the great potential of using XR techniques to provide field workers and all other project participants with augmented visualization and interactive experiences. Unfortunately, limited studies have synthesized the domain requirements and challenges for achieving safe and effective construction management using XR techniques.
Hence, according to the analysis of Figure 2 and the analysis of existing review studies, it is necessary to have a comprehensive synthesis of potentials, challenges, and use cases of XR in construction management. The major contribution and novelty of this review are synthesizing the requirements, challenges, and use case scenarios of using XR techniques for effective safety control, coordination, and collaboration in the construction management domain. The overall goal of this review is to (1) investigate the spatiotemporal distribution rule of relevant studies, (2) synthesize various XR implementation cases in different construction management scenarios and summarize the challenges related to XR applications, and (3) prospect potential application scenarios and application method improvements of XR in the construction management domain.
The organization of the following sections is as follows. Section 2 illustrates a motivation case by using a production safety accident to demonstrate the limitations of the existing construction management practices. Section 3 collects the studies of XR used in construction management to obtain accurate literature review data. Section 4 synthesizes the current state of XR in construction management based on the selected studies. This section also discusses the practical application challenges of XR for safe and efficient construction management. Section 5 proposes the potential application scenarios and application method improvements of XR for advancing construction management to inform future research activities. Section 6 summarizes the status and challenges of XR for safe and effective construction management.
A Motivating Case
According to the Construction Management Association of America (CMAA), construction management is a professional service that provides a project’s owner(s) with effective management of the project’s progress, quality, safety, and other aspects. However, construction project casualties, progress delays, and quality rework accidents still occur based on the current construction management practices. In this section, the authors selected a typical case of production safety accidents at construction sites published by the Ministry of Emergency Management, PRC, to analyze the limitations of the existing construction management methods (shown in Figure 3).
As shown in Figure 3, a collapse accident of a tower crane occurred in Huarong County, Hunan Province, China. The accident killed five people and caused more than RMB 5.8 million in direct economic losses. Accident reports indicate that the root cause of this accident was workers’ illegal disassembly operations, which caused the crane component to fall off. The managerial cause of this kind of accident can be summarized as follows. On the one hand, existing safety training on-site heavily relies on passive teaching methods (e.g., lectures, manuals, and videos). However, all such passive teaching methods lack real experience and could hardly achieve effective safety training for workers [25]. Therefore, it is necessary for the construction management domain to develop effective safety training programs with training environments that are interactive and free of security risks. On the other hand, experienced engineers are limited human resources at construction sites, which creates challenges in providing sufficient supervision and instructions for newly admitted construction personnel, and field engineers cannot fully and accurately detect all hazards and propose solutions on time [26,27]. In addition, the inspected information about quality or safety hazards cannot be directly displayed at construction sites, which leads to the failure of on-site workers to obtain this information [28]. Therefore, it is necessary to study the automatic method of quality control and safety inspection at construction sites and the effective transfer mechanism of risk information.
The analysis of construction management limitations.
Affected by the stoppage or rework of the construction project, this kind of accident can easily cause project delays. In this case, if the traditional progress inspection method is adopted at construction sites (i.e., the inspectors collect progress data from the site and conduct statistical analysis off-site to form progress inspection reports periodically to record the progress), the managers cannot grasp the completion of the site tasks in real-time and decide on schedule adjustments according to the difference between the completion state and the as-planned data [7,8]. Therefore, it is thus necessary to study the method of inspecting progress deviations automatically at construction sites.
This motivating case shows that several challenges impede safe and effective construction management: (1) it is not possible to provide workers with an interactive education and training environment without security risks, (2) experienced engineers are limited human resources at construction sites, which leads to the inability to provide workers
with intuitive and correct operation instructions, (3) progress deviation, quality defect, and safety facility defect cannot be inspected automatically in real-time according to the as-planned model and data, and (4) it is not possible to provide on-site workers with intuitive and real-time risk information.
Data Collection for the Literature Review
Obtaining accurate literature data related to the topic of this review is essential for analyzing published literature. In this study, the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Literature Review and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) framework was used to collect data. Since its launch in 2009 [29], PRISMA has been cited in more than 60,000 publications (Scopus, May 2022) and has been adopted in various disciplines. Similar studies in review studies published in journals such as the journal of Automation in Construction (Elsevier) and the journal of Buildings (MDPI) are based on PRISMA’s four-stage flow chart for data screening [30–33]. In this study, data screening was carried out according to the PRISMA flow chart updated in 2020 [34], and the data screening process is shown in Figure 4. In addition, the data of the literature search is till May 2022.
The data screening process.
Firstly, Web of Science (WoS), Scopus, and Google Scholar are important databases for obtaining global academic information. However, the literature retrieval and screening methods (e.g., retrieval items, research domain screening, and literature type screening) of Google Scholar are different from those of Web of Science and Scopus. Therefore, in this study, the authors have used the Web of Science and Scopus databases for literature retrieval, and the Google Scholar database is selected for supplementary literature retrieval.
Secondly, the keyword set used to retrieve literature related to the topic of this review is divided into two aspects, one is the keyword set related to “extended reality” (XRK), and the other is the keyword set related to “construction engineering and management” (CRK). Among them, the set of keywords related to “extended reality” was identified as:
XRK = “Immersive* Technology*” OR “Extended reality” OR “XR” OR “Virtual Reality” OR “VR” OR “Augmented Reality” OR “AR” OR “Mixed Reality” OR “MR” OR “virtual environment” OR “virtual prototype*”. The wildcard “*” retrieved any keyword with multiple spelling variants. For example, “virtual prototype*” can retrieve two keywords: “virtual prototype” and “virtual prototyping”.
The keyword set related to “construction engineering and management” (CRK) involves many topics. In addition, since the purpose of this study is to explore the application status of XR in the construction field of “three control, three management, and one coordination”, this study selected keywords not only from the overall perspective of “construction” or “AEC”, but also from the perspective of progress, quality, and safety. In this study, the following three methods are combined to select keyword sets: keyword co-occurrence analysis by using Citespace 5.8.R3, reference to previous review articles on extended reality and construction, and professional experience. In the management system of “three control, three management, and one coordination”, “information management” focuses on the research of “information management system”, “database”, and other related aspects [35–37]. The literature retrieved mainly belongs to the field of computer science, and the extended reality itself is the database. “Organizational coordination” belongs to pure management. “Organizational coordination” is mainly related to organizational structure, job responsibilities, and the development of organizational management measures, whereas the extended reality focuses on technical aspects. The above two aspects deviate from the theme of the application of extended reality in construction management, so they are not within the scope of this review. Therefore, the set of keywords related to “construction engineering and management” was finally identified as:
CRK1 = “construction” OR “AEC” OR “build*” OR “civil engineering*” OR “construction engineering*” OR “engineering*” OR “infrastructure” OR “BIM” OR “building information model*” OR “construction management” OR “project management” OR “built environment” OR “Lean construction” OR “green construction” OR “LEED”
CRK2 = “progress” OR “schedule” OR “workflow” OR “Critical-path Method” OR
CRK3 = “cost” OR “budget” OR “cost estimation” OR “quantity take-off” OR “finance”
OR “building* performance” OR “performance”
CRK5 = “safe*” OR “Health and Safety”
CRK6 = “contract*” OR “project delivery” OR “integrated project delivery” OR “Design Bid Built” OR “Design Built” OR “IPD” OR “DBB” OR “DB” OR “EPC”
Thirdly, the research domain used for literature retrieval was limited to the six major subject domains: civil engineering; environmental engineering; geological engineering; construction building technology; transportation science and technology; safety, risk, reliability, and quality.
Finally, the Web of Science and Scopus databases was searched, respectively, according to the following search formula:
TS = (“Immersive* Technology*” OR “Extended reality” OR “Virtual Reality” OR “Augmented Reality” OR “Mixed Reality” OR “XR” OR “VR” OR “AR” OR “MR” OR
“virtual prototype*” OR “virtual environment”) AND TS = (“construction” OR “AEC” OR “build*” OR “civil engineering*” OR “construction engineering*” OR “engineering*” OR “infrastructure” OR “BIM” OR “building information model*” OR “construction management” OR “project management” OR “built environment” OR “Lean construction” OR “green construction” OR “LEED” OR “progress” OR “schedule” OR “workflow” OR
“Critical-path Method” OR “Gantt Chart” OR “CPM” OR “time management” OR “cost”
OR “budget” OR “cost estimation” OR “quantity take-off” OR “finance” OR “quality” OR
“quality assurance” OR “quality control” OR “QA” OR “QC” OR “building* performance” OR “performance” OR “contract*” OR “project delivery” OR “integrated project delivery”
OR “Design Bid Built” OR “Design Built” OR “IPD” OR “DBB” OR “DB” OR “EPC” OR “safe*” OR “Health and Safety”) AND SU = (“Construction & Building Technology” OR
“Engineering, Civil” OR “Engineering, Environmental” OR “Engineering, Geological” OR “Transportation Science & Technology”)
TITLE-ABS-KEY(“Immersive* Technology*” OR “Extended reality” OR “Virtual Reality” OR “Augmented Reality” OR “Mixed Reality” OR “XR” OR “VR” OR “AR” OR “MR” OR “virtual prototype*” OR “virtual environment”) AND TITLE-ABS-KEY(“construction”
OR “AEC” OR “build*” OR “civil engineering*” OR “construction engineering*” OR
“engineering*” OR “infrastructure” OR “BIM” OR “building information model*” OR “construction management” OR “project management” OR “built environment” OR “Lean construction” OR “green construction” OR “LEED” OR “progress” OR “schedule” OR “workflow” OR “Critical-path Method” OR “Gantt Chart” OR “CPM” OR “time management” OR “cost” OR “budget” OR “cost estimation” OR “quantity take-off” OR “finance” OR “quality” OR “quality assurance” OR “quality control” OR “QA” OR “QC” OR “building* performance” OR “performance” OR “contract*” OR “project delivery” OR “integrated project delivery” OR “Design Bid Built” OR “Design Built” OR “IPD” OR “DBB” OR “DB” OR “EPC” OR “safe*” OR “Health and Safety”) AND SUBJTERMS(2215 OR 2205 OR 2305 OR 2213 OR 1909). Among them, 2215; 1909 belong to All Science Journal Classification Codes (ASJC) of the Scopus database. These codes, respectively, stand for building and construction; civil and structural engineering; environmental engineering; safety, risk, reliability, and quality; geotechnical engineering, and engineering geology.
Screening and Included
Firstly, to limit the year of literature review data, this study retrieved literature from the Web of Science and Scopus databases with XRK as the search keywords, subject as the search item, and research domain in Section 3.1 as the search domain. Figures 5 and 6 show the annual trends of publications obtained from the literature search. The data of the literature search is till May 2022, so the data for 2022 in Figures 5 and 6 is forecast data. Figures 5 and 6 show that the annual trend of published studies in the two databases is the same. Since the turning point in 2012, the number of published studies in the two databases has been consistently over 150 and 600 since 2013 and showing an obvious upward trend. At the same time, to ensure the timeliness of the retrieved literature, the literature years were finally limited to 2013 to 2022.

Secondly, studies with the type of “Article” are comprehensive and detailed elaborations of the latest research results by researchers. Moreover, journal studies will go through several rounds of strict review processes, and this type of literature provides high-quality academic information. Therefore, “Article” is selected for this review. At the same time, this review selected studies from international journals retrieved from the Web of Science and Scopus databases, so the literary language was limited to English.
After preliminary screening, a total of 3710 studies entered the title and abstract review process. According to the noun abbreviations, studies unrelated to construction engineering and management or extended reality were excluded. For example,”-Ar” stands for aromatic compounds occurring in the field of environmental engineering, and “magnetorheological (MR)” stands for magnetorheological, which has nothing to do with extended reality. After the title and abstract review process, a total of 1208 studies entered the full-text review process. In the full-text review stage, (1) literature in engineering education, landscape design, mechanical design, and other domains unrelated to construction engineering and management will be excluded; (2) literature that only carried out technical development or theoretical framework building without actual application or experimental verification will be excluded. Finally, seventy-two studies from the Web of Science and Scopus databases met the inclusion criteria.
In addition, the authors used the snowballing searching method in Google Scholar (i.e., searching for references and citations of the included studies) [31]. In this study, the authors used the snowballing search method for the above seventy-two included studies to identify six additional studies. The authors also retrieved the studies of the scholar with the largest number of studies on the application of XR in the construction management domain (the retrieved result obtained from Web of Science is scholar Wang), and the authors identified one additional study [38]. Finally, seventy-nine studies (seventy-two were retrieved from Web of Science and Scopus, and seven were supplementarily retrieved from Google Scholar) were included in the following data analysis.
Extended Reality for Safe and Effective Construction Management
Through a rigorous review of data sources, the authors have selected seventy-nine studies for further data analysis. Besides, the studies are divided into five categories related to construction management, including progress control, cost control, quality control, contract management, and safety management. Firstly, this study summarized the previous research on the application of extended reality in construction management, and the summary results are shown in Table 1. As can be seen from Table 1, (1) the application of extended reality in contract management of the “three control, three management, and one coordination” system is not reflected in the previous research work, whereas the application in safety management accounted for a very high proportion. In (2) virtual reality has the highest proportion of applications in safety management, whereas mixed reality has a very low proportion of applications in progress control, quality control, and safety management. Secondly, this study analyzed the temporal distribution, spatial distribution (Section 4.1), and research hotspots (Section 4.2) of the included studies.

Spatiotemporal Analysis of XR in Construction Management
Temporal Distribution
Cluster analysis can divide a large number of keywords into several research topics. The timeline analysis of keyword clustering also can consider the effect of time on research clusters. The timeline visualization of keywords can extract two types of information: (1) the first appearance year and duration of keywords and (2) the duration of the research topic. Therefore, the authors analyzed the temporal distribution of the included literature in Section 3 by timeline analysis. The timeline visualization of keyword clustering created by Citespace 5.8.R3 is shown in Figure 7. In this study, the six largest research clusters (#0-#5) were finally determined by the log-likelihood ratio (LLR) algorithm in cluster analysis. It can be seen from Figure 7 that: (1) since the two keywords “virtual reality” and “augmented reality” first appeared in two clusters (#3 and #4) in 2013, they have appeared in the included literature until 2022, which makes the keyword nodes show the characteristics of large nodes and color changes from purple to red. However, the keyword “mixed reality” did not appear in the six largest research clusters. In (2) the figure also shows the duration of each research cluster. For example, the cluster (#3) represented by “augmented reality” covers a period from 2013 to 2021, indicating a series of research results on the application of AR in construction management during these nine years. In summary, Figure 7 shows that VR/AR-related application studies have been hotspots in the construction management domain since 2013.

Spatial Distribution
Analyzing journal sources enables the presentation of influential journals in the research domain. This study visualized the journals where the data included in Section 3 are distributed, and the visualization result is shown in Figure 8. It can be seen from Figure 8 that: studies related to the application of XR in construction management are mainly distributed in the journal of Automation in Construction, the Journal of Computing in Civil Engineering, Buildings, and the Journal of Construction Engineering and Management. This result shows that the publications in these journals can provide researchers with the latest research basis.

Research Hotspots of XR in Construction Management
The application of XR in contract management is not reflected in the previous research work. The application in cost control is only reflected in one study, which is not analyzed as a separate section. Therefore, the research hotspot analysis was synthesized from progress control, quality control, and safety management. According to these research hotspots, the authors proposed an overall analytical framework from two perspectives: (1) a management perspective and (2) a technical perspective. Specifically, the proposed analytical framework from the management perspective is based on the textbook of the Constructor Examination in China and the related literature on construction management [24,39]. Besides, the proposed analytical framework from the technical perspective is based on the XR technical architecture proposed by the China Academy of Information and Communications Technology (CAICT). The specific analysis framework is shown in Figure 9. In addition, the analysis of each area is carried out from two aspects: (1) state-of-the-art studies of XR applications and (2) challenges related to XR applications.

Progress Control
Among the seventy-nine studies included in the analysis, nine studies were related to research topics in progress control. Overall, these relevant studies approach the progress control issues through the visualization of schedule, the automatic inspection of progress deviations, and the on-site visualization of inspection data. Moreover, among the nine XR systems developed in these studies, seven are AR systems, and the other two are VR and MR systems.
• State-of-the-art studies of XR applications
Regarding schedule visualization, on-site workers cannot interact with the 4D model (e.g., measuring distance, inspecting component types), which is not conducive to workers’ perception of the workspace [40]. In terms of on-site progress inspection, the traditional progress inspection methods are affected by subjective experience and are not conducive to the real-time grasp of the site progress. To address the issues mentioned above, Tallgren et al. [40] developed a VR-based project planning system that enables users to view and interact with 4D models in an immersive manner. Kopsida and Brilakis [8] proposed an indoor progress inspection method based on MR to inspect the progress deviations automatically. AR has the potential for on-site monitoring, project information retrieval, and real-time information sharing [4–6,41]. Therefore, some researchers have developed AR applications to realize the in situ presentation of project information and progress inspection data on-site building entities [7,42,43].
The above studies take XR as an in situ visualization tool and interactive tool for construction information. They have examined XR in the following engineering scenarios: (1) an immersive view of the construction process of complex building components and (2) in situ visualization of progress inspection data.
• Challenges related to XR applications
Using XR tools to assist progress control still has some application challenges. For example, Bae et al. [6] tracked and located the position and direction of mobile AR devices by matching the on-site image with the pre-established 3D point cloud model and then enhanced the progress information associated with the building elements in the on-site image. However, this tracking and positioning method has two challenges: (1) highresolution on-site images are conducive to accurate positioning, but there is a problem with the long matching time between 2D images and 3D point cloud models; (2) if AR devices only include building elements with few feature points (e.g., windows) in the camera’s view, the matching accuracy will be low. The above two challenges will lead to the low real-time level and accuracy of the site progress inspection information access. Kopsida and Brilakis [8] inspected whether the 3D objects included in the as-planned model exist in the actual scene by comparing the as-planned data (referring to the pre-established BIM model) with the as-built data (the spatial surface meshes covering the real object captured by MR devices). In this way, the site construction progress can be inspected. However, this inspection method has the following challenges: (1) the accuracy of mesh data captured by MR devices is limited; (2) the scanning results of MR devices are affected by weather conditions, observation angle of the object, and object material type (e.g., tiling, or surfaces with strong light absorption). This inspection method is unsuitable for inspecting small irregular objects’ progress, scanning outdoor environments in sunny weather, scanning objects at a shallow angle, and examining the progress of construction tasks related to the material texture. The specific application challenges mentioned in the previous research work in progress control are shown in Table 2.
