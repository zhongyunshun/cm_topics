The application of the concept of quality costs 3 originated in the manufacturing industry in the early 1950s.

Introduction
In recent years, increasing attention has been given to improving the overall quality of construction works. Many organizations have undertaken initiatives to implement various quality management techniques. Due to the success of total quality management (TQM) practices in the manufacturing industry, its application in the construction industry has received much attention. TQM may be presented in various theoretical forms, but its fundamental goals are customer satisfaction and continual improvement. According to Dale and Plunkett (1991), TQM not only leads to improved productivity, higher standards,
improved systems and procedures, improved motivation, and increased customer satisfaction, but also to lower costs and bottom line savings. Some construction industry companies have implemented TQM successfully, and reasons for these successful implementations were summarized by Kuprenas et al. (1996). In order to quantify the bene ts of TQM, quality must be measurable. Although there are numerous tools for measuring quality, the ‘cost of quality’ (or quality costs) is considered by both Crosby (1984) and Juran (1988) to be the primary one. Oberlender (1993) summarized quality costs as follows. ‘Quality costs consist of the cost of prevention, the cost of appraisal, and the cost of failure. Prevention costs are those resulting from quality activities used to avoid deviations or errors, while
8 be used to capture quality costs in construction projects. Pre-existing models for capturing construction quality costs, by Davis, by Abdul-Rahman, by Low and Yeo and by others, recognize quality cost compo9 nents but do not address the causes or sources of unwanted deviations. This paper proposes an alternative
3011	approach, based on the process cost model and in conformance with BS6143 (1992), which is thought to
1 better facilitate the fundamental goal of TQM, i.e. continual process improvement. A number of profes2 sionals involved in construction quality management were interviewed and responded favourably to the prac3 ticality of the proposed framework in the construction context.

appraisal costs consist of costs incurred from quality activities used to determine whether a product, process or service conforms to established requirements. Failure costs are those resulting from not meeting the requirements, and can be divided into two aspects. Internal failure costs are the costs incurred on the project site due to scrap, rework, failure analysis, re8 inspection, supplier error, or price reduction due to
9 non-conformance. External failure costs are costs that 1011 are incurred once the project is in the hands of 1 the client. These include costs for adjustments
2 of complaints, repairs, handling and replacement of 3 rejected material, workmanship, correction of errors, 4 and litigation costs.’
5 Through the measurement of quality costs, manage6 ment can be alerted to the potential impact of poor 7 quality on the  nancial performance of the company. 8 Moreover, management can also determine the types 9 of activities that are more bene cial in reducing quality
1 In construction, many organizations have imple2 mented quality assurance programmes, such as ISO 3 9000 and TQM, just as a means of staying in busi4 ness. In a recent survey (Ahmed and Aoieong, 1998), 5 a questionnaire was sent to 150 project managers/ 6 quality managers of contractors in the construction 7 industry in Hong Kong. Among the 30 respondents, 8 approximately 90% wrote down ‘ful lling clients’/ 9 authorities’ requirements’ as their reasons for imple3011 menting ISO 9000 while only 46% said ‘improve
1 pro tability’. In order to improve quality and pro t, 2 designers, consultants, contractors and also subcon3 tractors must do more than merely provide a minimum 4 level of assurance to their clients. They must aim at 5 reducing cost without sacri cing quality.
6 In the USA, the Construction Industry Institute 7 (CII, 1989) conducted research to identify and quan8 tify the rework costs of correcting quality deviations in 9 nine construction projects. It was found that the devi4011 ation costs averaged 12.4% of the total project cost. 1 With this high percentage of deviation costs, a slight 2 reduction may result in signi cant savings. In order to 3 do this, quality costs must be identi ed and assessed. 4 Clearly this points to the importance of knowing how 5 and where quality costs have been incurred, so that
6 remedial actions may be taken to prevent their recurrence, thereby reducing the costs of construction and bene ting contractors, clients and end-users. The result of the survey quoted above also showed that close to 60% of the respondents said that they had not attempted to measure defects-related costs. Those who did measure noted that the cost of correcting defects was approximately 5% of the total construction costs. Similar results (about 5–6%) were also reported by Abdul-Rahman (1995).
Dale and Plunkett (1991) reported that, despite the great quantity of literature discussing quality cost, there was no uniform view of what quality cost means and how it can be measured. Researchers have proposed various approaches for measuring and classifying quality costs, and reviews of the quality costs literature can be found in Plunkett and Dale (1987) and Porter and Rayner (1992). A brief summary of the most widely recognized approach, the preventionappraisal-failure (PAF) model, is as follows.
l Prevention costs. The cost of any action taken to investigate, prevent or reduce the risk of nonconformity or defects.
l Appraisal costs. The cost of evaluating the achievement of quality requirements.
l Failure costs. The costs of nonconformity both internally (discovered before delivery to the customer, including scrap, rework, re-inspection and redesigning) and externally (discovered after delivery to the customer, including warranty costs and service calls).
Although the PAF model is universally accepted for quality costing, Porter and Rayner (1992) described some of the drawbacks of this approach as follows.
l It is dif cult to decide which activities stand for prevention of quality failures since almost everything a well-managed company does has something to do with preventing quality problems.
l The key focus of TQM is on process improvement, while the PAF categorization scheme does not consider process costs.
The objective of this paper is to investigate whether or not the PAF model is suitable for capturing quality costs in the construction industry and, if not, what kind of a model will be more suitable.
Construction quality cost approaches by previous researchers
Quality costs in the construction industry as a whole are relatively high in terms of total project costs. However, due to the complexity of construction processes, measuring quality costs is often dif cult. An extensive literature review shows that, so far, only a few papers (Davis, 1987; Abdul-Rahman, 1995; Low and Yeo, 1998; Barber et al., 2000; Love and Li, 2000) have been written in the context of construction on how quality costs could be determined. The following is a brief discussion of their approaches.
Davis’ approach
In 1987, the CII (1989) Quality Management Task 8 Force developed a Quality Performance Management 9 System (QPMS) to track quality costs. It is a manage1011 ment tool providing for the quantitative analysis of 1 certain quality-related aspects of design and construc-
2 tion by systematically collecting and classifying the
3 costs of quality. The cost of quality is de ned as the 4 cost of correcting deviations (rework) plus the cost of 5 quality management activities. The QPMS is based on 6 the assumption that quality costs can be adequately 7 tracked using 11 rework causes and 15 quality manage8 ment activities. The rework causes, when coupled with 9 four phases of a project, give a total of 40 (instead of 2011 11 ´ 1 = 44) deviation categories with some illogical 1 combinations eliminated. Fifteen quality management 2 activities covering the main activities involved in design 3 and construction were used to track quality manage4 ment costs. Nine industrial projects were tested,
5 yielding an average cost of rework of 12.4% of the 6 project cost.
7 Although the QPMS is simple and  exible, Abdul8 Rahman (1995) stated that QPMS does not consider 9 the effect of failure on time-related cost and knock-on 3011 cost, i.e. the cost to speed up work to make up for 1 lost time. Moreover, the procedure does not show the 2 speci c source of problems, but rather  ve major 3 causes of origin, i.e. the owner, designer, vendor, trans4 porter, and constructor, were stressed (see Table 1).
5 Similar to the QPMS, Davis’ (1987) quality perfor6 mance tracking system (QPTS) is an updated version 7 of QPMS. In the QPTS, extensive costs coding to clas8 sify the various items were used so that costs data 9 captured will be compatible with the works breakdown 4011 structure (WBS) of a project. Attempts were made to 1 trace the sources of deviations by the use of source 2 codes. Source codes were assigned to the accepted 3 disciplines (civil, structural, electrical, and mechanical)
plus sources of deviations such as labour, equipment and contract. However, the speci c source of deviations was not recorded by the QPTS.
Abdul-Rahman (1993) developed a quality cost matrix to capture the cost of nonconformance during construction. The matrix lists such information as ‘problem category’, ‘speci c problem’, ‘when problem was discovered’, ‘causes of problem’, ‘extra duration needed to correct problem’, ‘additional cost of activity’, ‘amount of additional time-related cost’, and ‘any additional cost’. Two construction projects were used to test the model, and the total costs of nonconformance incurred were 5% (1995) and 6% (1996) of the tender value. In Abdul-Rahman’s cost matrix, the focus was on capturing the cost of nonconformance, and no attempts were made to quantify other classi cations of quality cost, including prevention and appraisal costs. In problem categorization, the items used were rather broad. In order to capture the cumulative effect of problems in a speci c area, effective cost coding, similar to that used by Davis, should be employed. Moreover, Abdul-Rahman did not consider the origin of deviations as Davis did. In the present authors’ view, in order to have a better understanding of quality costs data, the question ‘who caused the deviation? ’ should be essential.
Low and Yeo’s approach
Table 1	Summary of three models designed to capture quality costs



of prevention


In view of the shortcomings of Davis’ and AbdulRahman’s approaches, Low and Yeo (1998) proposed a construction quality cost quantifying system (CQCQS). The cost system is basically a documentation matrix that accounts for quality costs expressed as prevention, appraisal and failure costs. The headings of the matrix are ‘cost code’, ‘work concerned’, ‘causes’, ‘problem areas’, ‘time expended’, ‘cost incurred’ and ‘site record reference’. The main feature of this model is the use of coding to classify the various items under the heading ‘work concerned’. The items that constitute ‘work concerned’ can be obtained from the works breakdown structure (WBS) of a typical project. Under the heading ‘cost code’, various components of quality costs, such as prevention, appraisal and failure costs, can be classi ed. However, similar to Abdul-Rahman’s approach, the matrix was designed to capture the cost of failure primarily, and little effort
8 was made to quantify the prevention and appraisal 9 costs. Moreover, Low and Yeo also did not consider 1011 the origins of deviations.
Other approaches
4 Barber et al. (2000) developed a method to measure 5 costs of quality failures in two major road projects. The 6 method was based largely upon work-shadowing. 7 Personnel on-site were shadowed for a period of time 8 and the quality problems encountered were recorded. 9 Only direct costs of rework for the failures and the 2011 related costs of delay were included in their study. Of 1 the weekly budgeted cost of the speci c areas of work 2 studied, failure costs amounted to about 16% and 23% 3 of the weekly budget, respectively.
5 tude and costs of rework experienced in two construc6 tion projects. Data were collected from the date on 7 which construction commenced on-site to the end of 8 the defects liability period. A variety of sources such 9 as interviews, observations, and site documents were 3011 used to collect the rework data, and only the direct 1 costs of rework were included. The costs of extra work, 2 including variations and defects, were found to be 3 3.15% and 2.40% for the two projects. It was also 4 concluded that the primary causes of rework were 5 changes initiated by the client and end-user, together 6 with errors and omissions in contract documents.
Summary of the three major approaches
Measurement of failure cost was the focus of all 1 the  rst three models. However, only Abdul-
2 Rahman’s and Low and Yeo’s models pin3 pointed the causes of problems. While Abdul4 Rahman used wording to describe the problem 5 area, Low and Yeo found using codes to be 6 more convenient.
Measurement of prevention and appraisal costs is important due to the fact that they could be a signi cant part of the total quality costs. Without quanti cation, the relationship between prevention cost, appraisal cost, and failure cost cannot be fully understood. However, the de nition of what constitute quality management activities is somewhat arbitrary, and therefore exact de nition of each activity is necessary.
Extensive coding was used in Davis’ model to capture quality management costs and deviation costs. However, when compared with Low and Yeo’s model, the latter is easier to implement and less costly.
Only Abdul-Rahman considered the effect of failure on time-related cost and knock-on cost. The heading ‘any other additional cost’ was used in his cost matrix to capture any other remedial costs incurred indirectly due to the failure of an activity. It is essential to include the above as part of the cost of failure because this cost could be substantial. Without measurement, the full impact of the failures on the project costs cannot be determined.
Due to the short time frame involved, Low and Yeo’s model was not tested.
The speci c sources of deviations were not considered in Davis’ approach. It is essential to pinpoint the speci c source of deviations so that preventive measures can be employed and improvements can be made.
The three models’ similarities and differences are summarized in Table 1.
In principle, applying the quality cost concept to the construction industry is straightforward. However, in practice, it is rather complex. A recent survey carried out in Hong Kong (Ahmed and Aoieong, 1998) indicates that close to 60% of the respondents do not measure costs related to defects. The main reason for that could be just a lack of interest in knowing the quality costs. Moreover, it is rather dif cult to measure quality costs without the implementation of an effective quality cost tracking system. Last but not the least, all personnel, from top management to site staff, should be aware of the usefulness of quality cost data to the company. The top management should also do their best to remove any negative views on the system. Some of the main features of an ‘ideal’ quality tracking system are as follows.
The quality tracking system should be able to capture all components of quality costs. With one or more components missing, the effect of varying one component on the others cannot be visualized. Within each component of quality costs, standardization of category is necessary, so that meaningful data can be compared between projects. On the other hand, the categorization should be  exible enough to ensure that the system can be modi ed when necessary to suit different types of projects.
The use of a coding system in tracking quality costs is essential. As suggested by Low and Yeo (1998), the coding system should be compatible with the local quality assessment systems, if any.
The ease of use of the quality cost tracking system is essential. The system must be straightforward, because the people who would be 8 collecting cost data are the personnel on site. 9 Any extra workload created from the system 1011 must be kept to a minimum. Due to the highly 1 competitive environment in the construction 2 industry, it is impractical to implement any extra 3 system that would result in much extra work4 load to site staff.
The practicality of the quality cost tracking sys6 tem is essential. The main barrier to trying out 7 the system is the long construction time involved. 8 Recent interviews with some project managers 9 also indicated other barriers as listed below.
1	Improvement made based on the existing models
3 In PAF models, the three components of the quality 4 costs in the building contractor’s perspective are 5 prevention cost, appraisal cost, and deviation (failure) 6 cost. In order to obtain a general view from the 7 industry on the categorization of quality costs, exten8 sive in-depth interviews with contractors and local
9	authorities should be conducted as a  rst step in devel-
4011 oping the model. A list of quality management activi1 ties used in construction projects and a list of common
2 deviations that occurred on these construction sites can 3 then be established. Other than costs incurred from 4 the quality-related activities and deviations, the origin 5 of deviations is also a concern, as a deviation by any
6 of the participants may cause quality costs for that particular participant or for others. Typical quality management activities, cause and source of deviations are shown below.
Prevention activities: activities used to avoid deviations or errors
Most companies considered quality cost data as con dential, and therefore were very reluctant to release any data. The top management must be convinced that collecting quality costs is bene cial to the company. Lack of resources is another barrier. Depending on the complexity of the system, extra personnel would be involved in implementing the system, and that will result in extra cost to the company.

l Speci c area where problems occur, for exam-
Development of the coding system
In order to record and trace quality costs effectively, every item under each component of quality costs, the origin of deviations, and the source of deviations should be codi ed. The procedures can be summarized as follows.
l Conduct an investigation of the general practices in the construction industry with regard to the use of a coding system.
l Investigate the accounting procedures of contractors and attempt to integrate the coding system with the accounting cost coding system.
l Typical task codes can be generated from the work breakdown structure (WBS) of a typical project, using the standardized divisional breakdown (Masterformat) developed by the Construction Speci cation Institute (CSI). A master list of section titles and numbers can be found in the appendix of Oberlender’s (1993) book. Major ‘divisions’ include sitework, concrete, metals, wood and plastics, doors and windows, conveying systems, mechanical and electrical, etc. An example of the master list is shown in Figure 1.
l The management activity code, task code and cause code can then be generated after the development of the categorization of quality costs as discussed above. The origins of deviations can also be traced by using a proper coding system.
3 Development of the quality cost model:
4 With the categorization of quality costs developed and 5 the coding system in place, the next phase is the devel6 opment of a quality cost system to capture all the 7 quality-related costs. In the development of the system, 8 the users who would be operating the system must  rst 9 be identi ed. Most likely, the person who would be 3011 analysing quality costs data will be the quality manager 1 of the project. A user-friendly computer program 2 developed to track quality costs will de nitely make 3 the system easier to implement. In the development of 4 the computer program,  exibility is essential to ensure 5 that the system can be modi ed when necessary to suit 6 different types of project. On the other hand, the 7 people who would be recording quality costs data will 8 be the site staff. Considering their heavy workload, 9 attention must be given to the design of the site quality 4011 cost record sheets so that staff resistance can be 1 reduced to a minimum. Typical site record sheets for 2 recording prevention and appraisal costs and failure 3 costs are shown in Figures 2–4.
4 In recording the failure cost, record sheets can be 5 grouped together according to divisions (or subdivi-
6 sions) as shown in Figures 3 and 4. At the end of a project, with quality costs data collected from all sources, reports relating task, prevention, appraisal and failure costs can be generated readily from the program, as shown in Figure 5. Depending on the information required by the end-user, quality cost reports can bepresented in different formats. By grouping entries according to task code (division) as shown in Figure 6, the prevention, appraisal and failure costs of each division can be identi ed. Similarly, by grouping entries

8 according to activity code or cause code, as shown in 9 Figure 7, the prevention/appraisal cost of any particu4011 lar quality management activity and the failure cost of 1 a particular cause can be determined. Similarly, by 2 grouping entries according to origin code, as shown in 3 Figure 8, the distribution of failure costs among the par4 ties involved in the project can be determined.
Implementation of the model on a pilot project
After the development of the model, pilot projects should be conducted. A particular operation, concrete for example, of a building project should be selected  rst as a pilot study. Once the initial trial of the costs system is completed and if the result is satisfactory, projects involving full implementation of the model can then be conducted. Before the implementation of the model, training of the personnel involved is required.
Typical analysis of the data can include the following.
l The average quality costs of building projects expressed as a percentage of the total project cost.
l The distribution of quality costs according to the PAF categories. l The distribution of quality costs according to the origins (parties involved) in the project.
l The analysis of the interrelationship among prevention, appraisal and deviation costs.

A PAF cost model to capture the cost of quality for construction projects has been presented. In order to solicit the general view of the construction industry regarding the practicality of the model, extensive interviews with personnel in the industry were conducted.
Feedback from the industry about the proposed PAF model
In-depth interviews with leading construction contractors in Hong Kong were conducted. The details of the PAF approach described above were presented to the interviewees. Comments regarding the implementation 8 of such a quality cost tracking system based on the 9 PAF approach were obtained and are summarized in 1011 the following paragraphs. 1
4 The purpose of the interviews was to obtain views from 5 personnel involved in quality assurance on issues 6 relating to quality cost in the construction industry. 7 Twelve contractors were selected from the Hong 8 Kong Housing Authority list of building contractors. 9 They represented 38% of all the contractors who were
2011 eligible to tender for contracts valued at above 1 HK$300M (HK$7.80 = US$1.00). Nine interviewees 2 were quality managers while the remaining three held 3 senior managerial positions.
5	Discussion on results of interviews
7	Awareness of quality cost in the construction industry
8 All contractors interviewed have obtained ISO 9000 9 certi cation. Although all expressed that they were 3011 aware of the concept of quality cost, there was no 1 uniform view about what quality costs are or about 2 what should be included under the quality costs 3 umbrella. When the interviewees were asked if they
4 knew what is meant by quality costing, the majority 5 thought that it was just a process to measure the cost 6 of nonconformance. The reason for this incomplete
7 view of quality costing could be traced to the nature 8 of their jobs. Most of the interviewees are quality 9 managers, so probably their main concerns are costs 4011 related to nonconformance.
1 As far as the classi cation of quality cost is con2 cerned, the majority were aware of the quality cost 3 terms of prevention, appraisal, and failure. However, 4 after understanding the correct de nition of those 5 terms, most of the interviewees expressed that, in order
6 to avoid confusion, standardized classi cation of quality cost for the construction industry was essential.
Quality cost measurement
All interviewees said that they did not measure quality costs according to the PAF classi cation. Their reasons for not measuring could be summarized as follows.
a) No system set up for the measurement
In order to capture the quality costs of a project effectively, a quantitative system is essential.
No such system has been established in any one of the companies interviewed. The reason for not establishing such a system is the lack of resources. One interviewee commented: ‘The design of such a system is not too dif cult. However, it is nearly impossible to implement such a system on a construction project site.’
b) No resources available for the measurement Whether or not a company has extra resources to implement a quality cost measurement system depends very much on its pro t margin. All interviewees shared the view that measurement of quality costs is bene cial. However, due to the highly competitive nature of the construction industry, most contractors have to cut their pro t margin to a minimum in order to tender a bid successfully. It is for this reason that most contractors are reluctant to spend more to improve their quality system. One quality manager commented: ‘If we commit more on quality, more than the minimum required level, our construction cost will be higher than our competitors and therefore the project will most likely be awarded to others.’
c) Multi-level contracting hinders the measurement of the total quality costs
Subletting works by the main contractor to subcontractors is a very common practice in Hong Kong. Over 90% of the labourers on a building site belong to subcontractors (Tang et al., 1998). It is also very common to have a few levels of contracting between the general contractor and the labourers. In order to measure the quality costs of a particular trade, it would require the full co-operation of all levels of subcontractors. Bearing in mind that the subcontractors are under no obligation to do additional work to collect quality cost data, it would be rather dif cult to get their co-operation, even though there is a strong commitment from the general contractor. In order to capture the total quality costs of a project, all subcontractors from different trades have to be involved.
From the general contractor’s point of view, most contractors interviewed indicated that they were not enthusiastic about obtaining facts on quality costs. This is simply because most of the projects are contracted out, and only the  nal ‘product’ and not the ‘process’ is their concern. From the subcontractors’ point of view, instead of committing extra resources to collect data (which hinders the effectiveness in processing the works), they would much rather allocate their resources to rectifying problems.
Moreover, there is a negative side to the system because contractors/subcontractors will have to admit and report their mistakes during the implementation of the system, which they would rather not do.
Bene ts of measuring quality cost
8 In spite of the negative feedback, all interviewees 9 shared the view that there were merits in measuring 1011 quality costs. Some bene ts are listed as follows.
2	l Measuring quality costs helps in identifying
4 l Measuring quality costs helps in reducing the 5 cost of nonconformance.
6	l Results from quality cost analysis can be used in 7	the contractor/subcontractor selection process. 8	l Quality cost measurement is an effective tool for
9	the implementation of TQM.
2011	Personnel responsible for measuring quality cost
2 Most interviewees said that quantity surveyors and site 3 engineers would be in the best position to record 4 quality costs on site. They are the persons on site who
5 are responsible for the assessment and inspection of
8	Interview results
3011 In addition to the above comments, all interviewees 1 indicated that such a proposed model would be too 2 complicated to use in practice and straight implemen3 tation of the PAF model might not be possible. It was 4 probably due to the complexity of the structure of the 5 construction industry. The interviewees also suggested 6 that, if feasible, a more practical model for measuring 7 quality costs should be developed for the bene ts of 8 the construction industry.
1	An alternative approach to the traditional 2	PAF model for the construction industry
4 Unlike a production line in the manufacturing industry, 5 the construction process is far more complicated.
6 to the vast number of parties involved and the uniqueness of each activity in a construction project, straight application of the concept of quality cost based on a manufacturing setting is rather dif cult. However, if the measurement of quality cost is bene cial to the construction industry, attempts should be made to design a measuring system applicable to and acceptable by the industry.
Among the prevention, appraisal and failure costs, failure cost is the most dif cult to identify and collect.
As one quality manager expressed in an interview: ‘One will never get the whole picture of quality costs for a building project because there are so many parties involved’. Although this comment may be right, one can always focus on some areas of construction and determine the quality costs of the work done by a particular subcontractor. As another quality manager pointed out in an interview: ‘In order to easily attempt a trial on this quality cost exercise, we suggest simplifying the experimental model of building construction project in the areas where often quality nonconformance is found’. In other words, if there are not enough resources to implement the system on a full scale, a smaller scale implementation of the system can still be achieved. In fact, this is totally in line with the process cost model approach described in British Standard 6143 Part 1 (BSI, 1992).
In the past, the concept of quality costing has implied that certain identi able costs are in some way related to the ‘quality’ of the end product. By contrast, within today’s TQM culture all activities are related to processes, and therefore a cost model should re ect the total cost of each process.
The de nitions in BS 6143 Part 1 (1992) are as follows.
The total costs of cost of conformance (COC) and cost of nonconformance (CONC) for a particular process
Cost of conformance (COC)
The intrinsic cost of providing products or services to declared standards by a given, speci ed process in a fully effective manner Cost of nonconformance (CONC)
The cost of wasted time, materials and resources associated with a process in the receipt, production, dispatch and correction of unsatisfactory goods and services
In the traditional prevention, appraisal and failure approach, many costs can be attributed to either prevention or appraisal. Design reviews, for example, may be considered to be a prevention cost; however, essentially they are a checking stage and, as such, could be considered an appraisal cost. Moreover, it is always dif cult to decide which activities should be categorized as prevention cost because it can be argued that everything a well managed organization does is directed at preventing quality problems. This is one of the drawbacks of the PAF approach. A new approach, the process cost approach, presents a much simpler categorization than the PAF scheme. In the context of building construction, process cost models can be developed for any selected construction processes. The COC and/or CONC can then be measured and key areas for process improvement identi ed. Since usually both COC and CONC can be improved, the whole process is in tune with the fundamental goal of TQM, i.e. continual improvement. Since the TQM philosophy focuses on process improvement, the PAF approach has its limitations, because process costs are not considered in the cost categorization scheme.

7 Once a particular process is isolated, its boundaries 8 must be properly de ned so that all key activities will 9 be included for investigation. An organization’s 3011 resource availability must be considered when deter1 mining the process boundaries, so that no excessive 2 resources will be demanded. For example, the process 3 of concreting is bounded by the activities ‘formwork

In the context of building construction processes, the elements of the process (see Figure 10) could be expressed as follows.
Construction materials, such as concrete, admixtures, reinforcement, steel, waterstops, etc., that are transformed by the construction process to create building elements/system (shown at the left hand side of Figure 10)

A typical process cost report is shown in Figure 12. The report should contain a complete list of the costs of conformance and nonconformance elements. Items in Table 2 can be extracted directly for use in Figure 12 when they are applicable. The report should also specify whether actual or estimated costs are used. In addition, the process owner who is responsible for a particular key activity can also be included in the report.

Since construction processes are 7 dynamic in nature, it is essential that the data collec8 tion process commences only after the construction 9 processes become stable. Comparison with previous 3011 periods can then be made and areas for improvement 1 identi ed. Failure costs, in particular, should be prior2 itized for improvement through reduction in cost of 3 nonconformance. An excessive cost of conformance 4 may suggest the need for process redesign. It is also 5 essential that the process owners be involved in the 6 improvement team. A  owchart that depicts the steps 7 in implementing the process cost model is shown in

The focus is no longer on capturing the ‘total cost’ of the quality of an entire project, which is rather dif cult to do. Instead, speci c processes in a project can be identi ed for monitoring and improvement.
Winchell and Bolton (1987) did suggest that a smallscale PAF model could be used to measure quality costs in departments or sections of production. In the traditional PAF approach, total quality cost is essentially a build-up of many cost elements in many departments. The micro approach proposed by Winchell and Bolton, on the other hand, broke down the whole
8 system and evaluated the effectiveness of an individual 9 department. Although Gibson et al. (1991) had tested
1011	the micro approach in a manufacturing company,
1 there is no literature on testing such an approach in the
2 construction industry. It is the authors’ view that the
3 implementation of the micro approach in the construc-
4 tion industry is far less feasible than in the manufac5 turing arena, because production in a manufacturing 6 company relies on contributions from different depart7 ments within a company, whereas the ‘ nal product’ of 8 a construction company depends on the work con9 tributed by individual subcontractors (many different
2011 companies). Also, for a PAF model, it is rather dif cult 1 to distribute accurately the prevention costs to individ2 ual construction processes, for example, the cost of 3 maintaining a quality assurance system can be esti4 mated readily for a construction project; however, the
5 allocation of this cost to particular processes is not
Moreover, the micro PAF model does not include 7 process costs, and therefore it is not fully compatible 8 with the TQM concept of continual improvement.
Focus is no longer on the categorization of costs 3011 (P, A and F), which may be quite dif cult and unsat1 isfactory. As pointed out in BS 6143: ‘Many of the costs 2 can be justi ed as  tting into any one of the three cat3 egories, i.e. prevention, appraisal, and failure. Process 4 cost model offers a simpler categorization’ (BSI, 1992). 5 3. Since the focus is no longer on capturing the ‘total 6 cost’ of quality of an entire project, the demand of 7 resources is considerably less, and much of it can be
8 allocated to a particular process identi ed for moni9 toring and improvement.
2	Industrial feedback on process cost model
4 Eight construction professionals (two quality managers, 5 two quantity surveyors, two ISO 9000 quality manage-
6	ment system certi cation of cers, a site agent and a
civil engineer) were approached, and the details of the proposed process cost model (PCM) were presented to them. Their comments are summarized as follows.
Discussion on results of interviews
Flexibility and practicality
All interviewees shared the view that applying the model (PCM) in the construction industry is much more feasible than applying the traditional PAF model. When applying the PCM model, the resource level required in quality cost measurement will be more  exible, because the number of processes selected for monitoring can be varied according to the resources available. Moreover, when applying the PCM model, the timing in quality cost measurement is less rigid, because performance is only measured at selected periods.
Subcontractors’ co-operation
In the PAF model, in order to capture the total quality cost of a project, it would require the full co-operation of all subcontractors. All interviewees agreed that, unlike the PAF model, the number of subcontractors involved in the PCM could be kept to a minimum, depending on the processes selected. For example, the number of subcontractors involved in the concreting processes could be as low as four. However, some interviewees still believed that it would be dif cult to obtain the subcontractors’ co-operation, because of the reasons given earlier.
In addition to the above, the two interviewees from certi cation bodies (certi cation of cers) believe that the process cost model could be used as a simple tool to measure process improvement, a requirement in the latest edition of the ISO 9000 which, in addition to client satisfaction and continual improvement, emphasizes the process approach. Yet, they shared the view that it might be too early to comment on the new approach, since so far it has not been used as a tool to satisfy ISO requirements by any contractors in the industry.
Conclusions and suggestions for future research
Quality works in the construction industry have assumed increasing importance in recent years. Since the Hong Kong Government announced the requirement that all main contractors must attain the ISO 9000 certi cation for their projects from 1993 onwards, about 400 ISO9000 certi cates have been awarded to Hong Kong-based construction companies. Following the implementation of ISO 9000 in the construction industry, it is imperative to know whether improvement in quality has been achieved or not. There are many ways for determining this. One of the ways to measure quality improvement is through the measurement of quality costs. In order to quantify the bene t after the implementation of the ISO 9000 quality system, a quality cost model is proposed in this paper. Some of the bene ts of knowing how and where quality costs are incurred are listed as follows.
Quality cost data alert management of the potential impact of poor quality.
Quality cost data help management determine the types of activity that are most bene cial in
Quality cost data makes all personnel aware of the importance of quality works.
Quality cost data indirectly urge people in the industry to pay attention to continual improvement, which is a basic requirement in the implementation of TQM, and is consistent with the spirit of the latest version of ISO 9000.
6 Valuable feedback regarding the practicality of the
7 proposed model was obtained by interviewing some 8 leading main contractors in Hong Kong. Comments 9 from the interviewees indicated that straight imple2011 mentation of the PAF model might not be possible 1 due to the complexity of the structure of construction
2 industry.
3 An alternative approach, based on the BS 6143 4 process cost model (PCM), is proposed. To the 5 authors’ best knowledge, such a BS 6143 conceptual 6 model is now proposed the  rst time for use in the
7 construction industry. This approach is much more 8 feasible than the previously proposed PAF model as 9 one can select any processes within a project for study. 3011 Moreover, the 2000 version of the ISO 9000 standard 1 places much attention on a requirement for measure2 ment and monitoring of customer satisfaction through 3 reviews and ‘continual improvement’. The process 4 approach proposed could serve as a simple tool for 5 compliance with the Standard. Due to limited time, 6 the authors were unable to test the proposed model. 7 Further work on testing the model is recommended
8 and is planned for the near future.
