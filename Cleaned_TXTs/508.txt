The globalization of international construction markets provides tremendous opportunities for contractors to expand into new foreign markets. However, entry decisions for international construction markets are very risky and more dif cult than those for domestic markets, due to the wide variety of uncertainties and complexities associated with the international construction domain. This paper focuses on developing and testing a ‘risk-based go/no-go decision-making model’ for contractors who wish to expand into international construction markets. The go/no-go decision model applies the cross-impact analysis (CIA) method to assess the various uncertainties associated with international construction. This research draws signi cant  ndings regarding the bene ts of this go/no-go decision model from experimental studies involving 56 participants.

Introduction
The globalization of international construction markets provides tremendous opportunities for contractors to expand into new foreign markets by allowing local  rms to compete internationally (CII, 1993; ENR, 1997). However, entry decisions for international construction markets are dif cult, due to the uncertainties and complexities associated with the international construction domain. International projects involve not only the uncertainties that arise in domestic construction projects, but also those from the complex risks that are particular to international transactions (Lee and Walters, 1989; Hill International, 1995).
Despite the risky nature and complexity of these entry decisions, most construction  rms have entered international markets based on personal intuition or previous experience, both of which are easily in uenced by uncertainties and biases (Messner, 1994).
Moreover, existing decision tools and methods to evaluate international construction projects are incomplete and rudimentary.
In the context of doing business successfully in the globalizing construction markets, construction  rms need reliable risk analysis and decision making tools to make consistent strategic go/no-go entry decisions. The fundamental goal of this paper is to introduce a risk-based, market entry decision (go/no-go) model designed to help contractors make better market entry decisions for international projects. The remainder of this paper focuses on four questions.
What are the characteristics of go/no-go decisions for international construction projects?
What are the essential elements of go/no-go decisions?
How should one formalize a market entry decision procedure?

Globalization pressures have created more opportunities for contractors to enter international construction markets. According to Han (1999), the potential international markets accessible to foreign  rms due to globalization of the industry total approximately US$ 428 billion.
However, international projects manifest more risks and complexity than do domestic projects. For example, international construction is very sensitive to regional conditions such as currency devaluation, currency exchange restrictions, cultural differences, or unstable laws or regulations. A number of authors have described the risks speci c to international construction projects (Ashley and Bonner, 1987; Lee and Walters, 1989; Demacopoulos, 1989; Messner, 1994; Hill International, 1995; Kalayjian, 2000). The classi cation displayed in Figure 1 partitions international construction risks into  ve categories: political risks, economic risks, cultural/legal risks, technical risks and other special risks related to international construction. The variety of these risks suggests the need for a formal methodology to incorporate the risks into a go/no-go decision.
According to Engineering News Record (ENR, 1995– 1998), international construction projects are more risky but more pro table than domestic projects. Almost 15% of companies among the ‘top 225 global
contractors’ have sustained losses on their international projects, whereas they sustained losses on only 10% of their domestic projects. However, the average pro t from foreign work among these ‘top 225 global contractors’ was 9.34%, whereas that from domestic projects was 7.65% during the period 1994–1997. This implies that international construction contractors assume higher risks, but receive higher returns for their efforts.
According to MacCrimmon and Wehrung (1986), decision-makers are more risk averse in opportunity situations than in threat situations. As a consequence, contractors are less self-assured regarding go/no-go decisions for international projects than for doing work in domestic markets. Perhaps this explains why, in contrast to the globalization trend, only 19% of the current ‘top 400 US contractors’ actively seek and conduct international contracts (ENR, 1998). In particular, small and medium size  rms, those that ranked between 100 and 400 among the ‘top 400 US contractors’, rarely participate in international construction markets. Because small and medium size  rms are less likely to enter culturally distant markets, these  rms are forced to seek low-risk, low-growth alternatives.
In addition to its risky nature, entering international construction markets is a highly integrated, complex decision. Market entry decisions consist of three sequential stages: (1) identi cation of countries that
Figure 1 Breakdown structure of risks (revised from several sources including Ashley and Bonner, 1987)
are favourable in which to do business; (2) selection of candidate projects within a candidate country; and (3) determination of whether to ‘go or not to go’ on a speci c project opportunity. The complex, sequential nature of entry decisions makes the decision tools and methods for evaluating international construction opportunities dif cult.
A variety of information must be integrated in a comprehensive go/no-go decision model. Country conditions, project bid conditions and alternative project risk reduction strategies affect the likely project outcomes.
Country conditions and bid requirements
Country conditions are external variables that determine the initial circumstances of a particular project, such as political, economic or cultural conditions. Bid conditions are based on the bidding documents or the results of the initial negotiations between the owner and contractor. Typically, items that are subject to early determination include:
Risk-based bid decision for overseas construction projects
1. payment methods (US dollars, local currency),
2. currency exchange rate applied to a contract
3. payment term (monthly or quarterly),
4. applicable contract law (international standard contract, local rules),
5. contract languages (English, local),
7. tax reduction/exemption conditions (tariff, income tax, etc.), and
8. contractor  nancing requirements (ex, paid by owner after completion).
Risk reduction strategies
Many of the risks inherent in international construction can be mitigated or avoided by adoption of appropriate project execution strategies. A strategic decision can be de ned as an act or choice between a set of feasible and available action courses, tending to improve the organization’s goals (Messner, 1994). As an example, if the  rm has suf cient resources and the technological ability to perform the project, but the project conditions are much riskier than normal, the  rm could choose to negotiate a favourable dispute resolution process. Table 1 shows representative strategies designed to improve the  rm’s capacity to perform or to improve a project’s particular conditions.
Traditionally, a go/no-go decision is viewed as focusing on maximizing pro t as a sole consideration. However, according to several researchers, the underlying decision foundation is not totally pro t-oriented, but is affected by a multi-attributed set of decision criteria (Ahmad, 1990). In addition to pro t, companies often pursue projects based on multi-criteria outcomes, such as gaining future markets, their need for work, developing new relationships, etc. Therefore, the go/no-go decision includes multiple outcome variables.
In this problem domain, we conceptualize the go/ no-go decision as one that is decided based primarily on a project pro t criterion. If a project fails to satisfy the pro tability criterion, other potential bene ts of pursuing the project are considered, as shown in Figure 2. In this process, the decision-maker sets an absolute goal on ‘expected project pro tability’ above which the decision is ‘de nitely go’. The decision-maker also sets a lower pro tability limit to  x the ‘de nitely no-go’ decision. If project pro tability lies between these pro tability limits, the decision is made by considering both ‘project pro tability’ and ‘other project bene ts’.

There are many approaches to dealing with uncertainties in risk/decision analysis. Historically, the mathematical theory of probability is the most widely used uncertainty-reasoning tool. In addition to probability theory, there are other numerical calculi for the explicit representation of uncertainty, or techniques to manage uncertainty using logic or other symbolic formalism (Shafer and Pearl, 1990). This section compares the advantages and disadvantages of several common uncertainty reasoning tools as suggested by various authors (Cooper and Chapman, 1987; Diekmann et al., 1988; Flanagan and Norman, 1993; Takayuki, 1994).
Perhaps the most common methods for evaluating potential projects are designed to measure a project’s  nancial characteristics, such as net present value (NPV), internal rate of return (IRR), break-even point, or cash  ow. Although project  nancial analysis can provide speedy evaluation of a project, it cannot address all risk factors that are critical to a go or nogo decision (Ock, 1998). Traditional  nancial analysis is not an appropriate method for evaluating project feasibility when large and long term systems are married to uncertainties, because it cannot re ect the risk-based contingencies in the evaluation of strategic alternatives (de Neufville, 1990).
Probability theory
Frequently, probability theory is used where the decision is best represented as a sequence of related decisions and variables. Also, it is used to recast a complex decision sequence into several smaller related decisions. However, too much complexity in the form of correlated random variables can make this approach dif cult in the case of complex decision problems.
A neural network technique is a statistical learning algorithm, drawn from the  eld of arti cial intelligence. It adopts non-parametric regression estimates made up of a number of interconnected, processing elements between input and output data. It is superior in mean convergence, but highly sensitive to the data set and training set. Therefore the result may not be suf ciently robust when used to predict output using newly observed data.
In uence diagrams are good at modelling the conditional probability relationship among random variables. They are more versatile than a decision tree and able to handle a large amount of model complexity. They are used for both model formulation and analysis, and thus serve both quantitative and qualitative purposes. However, in uence diagrams require a detailed accurate representation of the probabilistic relationships among the decision variables.
Cross-impact analysis (CIA) method
Most of these traditional uncertainty-reasoning techniques require signi cant data collection, formulation of mathematical representations, assessment of conditional probabilities, or de nition of probability density functions. However, uncertainties involved in international construction are dif cult to assess using traditional tools such as probability theory and in uence diagrams, because the data required for the model are highly judgmental, and either unavailable or very expensive to collect. Additionally, the go/no-go decision model entails a dynamic multi-stage decision process and a highly complicated relationship among the risk variables, so that it is very hard to assess the accurate probabilistic relationship between variables. For these reasons, all of the more traditional
uncertainty reasoning methods were rejected for this application, and the cross-impact analysis (CIA) method was adopted for this go/no-go application.
The CIA method is a technique speci cally designed to predict future events by capturing the interactions among the variables of the model. The original CIA method was developed by Gordon and Hayward (1968), in an attempt to take into account impacts among separate future events. In the CIA method, each variable is described by an initial probability, and the interconnections between these variables are modelled by cross-impact relationships. The basic cross-impact relationship between two variables describes how the initial probability of a conditional variable will be inhibited or enhanced if a conditioning variable occurs.
Originally, the computational mechanism for determining the impact of a conditioning variable on the posterior probability of a conditional variable was expressed by the quadratic relationship equation (Gordon and Hayward, 1968). Subsequently, researchers have proposed alternative methods for calculating the posterior probabilities. For example, Honton et al. (1985) adopted a categorical approach to estimate the posterior probability by specifying for the direction and strength of the intervariable impacts. An index number between 23 and +3 is used to express the cross-impact relationship, and then this number is used to calculate the impact using an analytical expression with a more rigorous mathematical formulation. Alarcon (1992) developed the concept of cross-impact relation patterns in order to simplify the knowledge acquisition demands of the traditional CIA methods. The cross-impact relation patterns between variable pairs are classi ed into: (1) SIG2, signi cantly in the opposite direction;
MOD–, moderately in the opposite direction; (3) SLI2, slightly in the opposite direction; (4) SIG+, signi cantly in the same direction; (5) MOD+, moderately in the same direction; and (6) SLI+, slightly in the same direction.
Based on the CIA relation patterns, the posterior probability can be predicted throughout the series of analytical processes (a brief description of CIA analysis methodology is presented in Appendix A). The general steps for the CIA method are: (1) de ne variables to be included in the analysis; (2) determine the initial probability of each variable; (3) judge the CIA relations for each variable pair; (4) repeatedly perform the cross-impact calculations by Monte Carlo simulation; and (5) evaluate the posterior probability to forecast future events.
The CIA method is a powerful technique for dealing with ill-de ned uncertainty. In contrast to other uncertainty reasoning tools, the CIA method places relatively minor data demands on the decision-maker. The CIA method generates various scenarios that are used to analyse the sensitivity of variables, and produces multicriteria outputs that include mean values and probabilistic distribution shape. Accordingly, the CIA method is more effective than other tools in the following circumstances, which exactly match this problem domain.
l The model involves very complex and unclear relationships among variables; the CIA method is excellent at integrating political, economic, and technological factors.
l The data required for the model are scarce, unavailable, or very expensive to collect, and it is easier to elicit ‘subjective’ probability information using the CIA categorical approach than a standard probability approach.
l The model involves various possible decision alternatives. The CIA method can show the results of various possible decision alternatives by using scenario analysis when the decisionmaker cannot ascertain that a single solution is optimal.
An ideal go/no-go model incorporates all of the important project, bid and country conditions. Additionally, it allows the decision-maker to evaluate alternative project strategies and it provides for evaluation of all of the multiple outcomes of the project, both pro t and non-monetary bene ts. A decision model using the CIA framework was developed that satis es all of these requirements. The variables included in the model were de ned through an extensive literature review, multiple expert interviews and a preliminary case study (Han, 1999).
CIA cause–effect relationships model
The CIA method encapsulates the knowledge about a go/no-go decision into a cause–effect relationship map. This map provides both a classi cation of the variables in the model and their inter-relationships, and it provides a computational basis for decision making (Figure 3). The CIA model includes 32 variables along with their CIA relationships. The CIA relationships are not  xed: they are  exibly modi able according to the country conditions, project conditions, and the decision-maker’s context speci c knowledge. It helps to understand this very complex model by conceptualizing the model’s variables as belonging to one of  ve groups, as shown in Figure 4.
One set of variables, ‘country conditions’, represents each country’s unique a priori atmosphere for conducting trade. The country conditions are cultural and legal conditions, political conditions, economic condi-

tions, geography and climate conditions and environmental conditions. Each of these overlying conditions impacts (in the cross-impact sense) several other variables. Country conditions are relatively  xed for any given country; however, over the lifecycle of a project the economic, cultural and political conditions can change, and therefore they are treated as being uncertain.
A second set of variables represents the construction contractor’s decision strategies. Speci cally, the contractor’s resources, experience, management skill, owner relationships and strategic partnerships are de ned as strategic variables. Contractor’s strategic variables are presumed to be controllable in that a contractor can hire more talented or experienced people, change its strategic alliances or commit more resources.
The third and largest set of variables is those that are impacted by either the country condition or decision strategies, and these are called intermediate variables. The intermediate variables are divided into those that are impacted by the contractor decision strategies (the controllable variables) and those that are not controllable variables. These variables provide the means to propagate the impacts (indeed the cross-impacts) of the initial conditions (country condition and contractor’s decision strategies) to the model results.
The fourth type of variable re ects the probable outcomes of the project, i.e. a successor variable set for producing the  nal results. There are three project outcomes, namely, project cost uncertainty, project schedule uncertainty and contractor’s ability to perform the project. In addition, there are three corporate outcomes, namely, potential for future work, importance of developing market share, and importance of the developing relationship with the client.
The  fth set of variables is the outcome variables on the basis of which the go/no-go decision is made. There are two outcome variables, the ‘project pro tability’ outcome and the ‘other bene ts’ outcome. The project pro tability outcome is a combination of the previously mentioned successor variables (cost, schedule, and
ability to perform). The other bene ts outcome is a combination of the previously mentioned corporate outcomes (client relationship, future work and market share).
In practice, one employs the model by de ning the initial country conditions, the initial contractor decision strategies and the appropriate cross-impact relationships for the model. Using the cross-impact method, the initial and strategic conditions are propagated through the model to the outcome variables. The value of the outcome variables provides the normative metric on the basis of which the go/no-go decision is made.
The impact of alternative decision strategies that could be used to mitigate or avoid a risk can be evaluated analytically using the CIA method. Figure 5 is a matrix showing various project risk reduction strategies. The CIA model can be used to assess the impact of these alternatives on the project outcomes. The tick mark represents the possible impact of the decision strategies on the controllable variables. For example, if a contractor selects ‘alliance strategies’ to develop a new organization, they can partially or fully control certain types of risk variable (i.e. partner/subcontractor’s concern, lack of management skill, production technology availability, and familiarity with work). To evaluate the effectiveness of an alliance strategy the decision-maker would suitably alter the strength relationship of the CIA model. Based on the trial results, a decision-maker can evaluate which alternative strategies are the most effective in improving project outcomes.
Testing the CIA model
A test of a CIA-based go/no-go model was conducted to validate the anticipated bene ts of the model.

test the value of the CIA model was measured based on ‘decision quality’. Decision quality is a function of the independent variable decision tools, decision-makers’ international experience, and project conditions. The following equation implies the research question of whether independent variables (Xi) can cause the dependent variable (Y) in a hypothesized way.
56 subjects from three different experience backgrounds (19 novice graduate students, 18 inexperienced industry persons, and 19 experienced industry persons) participated in this study. These three groups were divided equally into two subgroups comprising an ‘intuition group’ and a ‘CIA-based go/no-go model group’. As indicated by the subgroup names, the intuition group used their intuition combined with rudimentary  nancial analysis to make the go/no-go decision. The CIA group used the CIA-based model to make the go/no-go decisions.
Experimental designs can be categorized broadly into three types: pre-experimentation, true experimentation, and quasi-experimentation. Additionally, each experimental design type is categorized further into: (1) within group or between group; (2) one group or multiple group; and (3) before–after or only–after test (Malhotra, 1993; Martin, 1996; Garziano and Raulin, 1997).
For this paper, a ‘randomized multiple-groups only–after design (between group) was selected for the experimental case study design in order to: (1) avoid the transfer and practice effect by assigning one participant for only one level, i.e., either intuition or the go/no-go decision model; (2) minimize the differences between groups by matching novice graduate students, inexperienced and experienced industry groups; and (3) hide the research hypothesis in order to avoid a predisposition toward a desirable response. (The participants from different groups were assigned randomly to the experimental test, i.e. randomized multiplegroups, and each participant was tested at only one level, so that the testing effect could be eliminated (only–after between groups).) Table 2 shows the framework of experimental case study format.
One of three hypothetical, international projects was assigned at random and equally to each participant in an attempt to prove the research hypothesis regardless of the project types and participants’ experience. These case projects were designed to provide various country and project conditions, such as a power plant in Laos, a housing project in India and a highway project in China. Based on a consensus of prior expert assessment and independent risk and economic analyses, the Chinese project was assessed to be a ‘good’ candidate project; the Laos project a ‘moderate’ candidate; and the Indian project a ‘poor’ candidate. The suggested correct decisions were veiled from all participants in order to avoid any potential biases. The details of each project are shown in Appendix B.
Each study participant was asked to make a go/nogo decision and asked to respond to several questions that measured how well the different decision tools affected: (1) decision correctness (percentage of right decision); (2) decision con dence and reliability for their  nal decisions (qualitative rating scale from 1, not con dent, to 7, very con dent); (3) decision dif culties in making judgments in uncertain environments (qualitative rating scale from 1, not dif cult, to 7, very dif cult); (4) decision formulation for understanding a complex problem domain (qualitative rating scale from 1, not very helpful, to 7, very helpful); and (5) decision consistency (percentage of decisions that changed when the experiment was repeated at a later date).
Research  ndings
Table 3 summarizes the experimental  ndings. To evaluate the research hypotheses, statistical methods were used to analyse the data, so the results and conclusions are objective rather than judgmental in nature. Comparisons of mean/standard deviation values and an analysis of variance (ANOVA) were performed.
As shown in Table 3, the intuition-based decisionmakers were confounded by the complexity of the circumstances. As a result, only 70% of the decisions made by the intuition group were correct. By contrast, 96.2% of the decisions made by the CIA model group were correct. There were numerous factors that caused the subjects to make incorrect decisions. In the case of the intuition group, the go/no-go decision was in uenced by the complexities and several biases, such as:
(1) decision-makers focused on only the negative decision factors like unfavourable political/ economic risks, government control and competitive bid type, rather than other various positive aspects;
(2) decision-makers ignored some relevant factors such as possibility of future market and  rm’s need for entering overseas markets;
(3) decision-makers simply counted the number of risks;
Interestingly, most of the type I errors (‘go’ decisions for bad or moderate projects) were made by the
Inexperienced industry group

novice group, while type II errors (‘no-go’ decisions for good projects) were made by industry participants focusing on negative factors. In addition to decision correctness, the CIA group experienced higher levels of decision quality than did the intuition-based decision making group. Decision quality was measured by: (1) higher decision con dence; (2) less dif culty in arriving at a decision; (3) higher degree of guidance from the model in formulating a decision; and (4) better long term consistency in their decisions.
Another distinctive  nding is that the go/no-go decision model was more helpful for novices and the inexperienced group than for the experienced group (Table 4). For example, although the go/no-go decision model increased the decision correctness for all groups, it was more helpful for novices (67% increase) and the

bThe correctness of the decisions was counted as the number of right decisions out of the subtotal of each group. The decision con dence level was measured using a qualitative index number ranging from 1 (not con dent) to 7 (very con dent), the decision dif culty ranged from 1 (not dif cult) to 7 (very dif cult), and the decision formulation ranged from 1 (not very helpful) to 7 (very helpful).

inexperienced group (33% increase) than for the experienced group (22% increase). These results support the hypothesis that a model can assist contractors, particularly inexperienced  rms, who wish to expand into overseas markets.
The go/no-go decision model incorporates a number of useful features. First, it includes a wide variety of factors (variables) that are important to go/no-go decisions. Second, it provides a rich context for modelling the relationships among decision variables. Third, it allows the decision-maker to include uncertainty in the decision formulation and to evaluate the effect of uncertainty on project desirability. Fourth, the model allows the decision-maker to de ne a multi-dimensioned project outcome variable. Finally, the model allows the decision-maker to evaluate alternative decision strategies.
A variety of signi cant  ndings are identi ed from the validation tests. First, the model consistently improved decision quality in terms of increasing decision correctness, enhancing decision con dence, reducing decision dif culties, assisting with the formulation of complex decision problems, and increasing Table 4 Improvement of decision quality of each group

decision consistency. Second, although the go/no-go model increased the decision quality for all groups, it was more helpful for novices and inexperienced group than for the experienced group. Third, both novices and industry participants repeatedly showed that go/no-go decisions based on intuition were in uenced by the complexity of uncertain information and several biases. Fourth, decision-makers felt less con dent and more challenged regarding case 3 (China, good project) and case 1(Laos, moderate project) than with their decision for case 2 (India, poor project). Consequently, most of the intuition subjects assigned case 2 made perfect decisions, while approximately 42% of intuition participants assigned case 1 and case 3 made wrong decisions. Fifth, industry participants were more risk averse than novices. They indicated higher values in the project pro tability for ‘de nitely go’. They also required a higher degree of other bene ts from the project for a ‘go’ decision. Finally, the Korean industry participants demonstrated more risktaking attitudes than those of the US participants.
Based on the test results, the CIA-based go/no-go model is worth promoting as an advanced analytical tool for contractors, especially for small and medium size  rms planning expansion into international construction markets. Future research will concentrate on the extension of the current go/no-go model for other entry decision stages, such as country screening tools and candidate project selection tools within a country.
