Extant studies have highlighted numerous barriers to carbon reduction but none seem to have been done in the context of construction process in the UK. Hence, this study aims to bridge this gap by investigating the barriers that are critical to the minimization of construction carbon footprint in the UK. A questionnaire was developed based on the carbon reduction barrier variables identified through a comprehensive literature review and pilot study. Then a survey was conducted amongst construction professionals in the UK and the data obtained were analyzed using mean ranking technique and factor analysis. The mean ranking analysis gave rise to 15 critical barriers to carbon reduction and their factor analysis yielded four dissimilar factors which are, resources and prioritization; policy and standards; risk and commitment; and awareness and complexity. The findings imply that these classifications can be used to describe carbon reduction barriers in the UK. This could stimulate a better comprehension of the critical barriers and provide a foundational basis for further research within the sustainable construction domain. Also, the result of this study could facilitate the need for collaboration between construction stakeholders in the UK to proffer pragmatic solutions to the identified challenges of carbon minimization.

Introduction
The construction process carbon emission has been noted to be underestimated and this can be attributed to the complex nature of construction projects (Wu et al. 2019). This deflation has led to the notion that the construction phase emission is quite small (Kong et al. 2020; Arogundade et al. 2021a). Hence, resulting in it being largely ignored in built environment decarbonization efforts (Arogundade et al. 2023). However, according to Acquaye and Duffy (2010), about 20% of Ireland’s total carbon emission in 2005 is linked to construction activities. Also, Huang et al. (2018) reported that in 2009, the construction sector in China, India, and the EU-27 (including the UK) contributed 38%, 30%, and 18% respectively to their country’s national emissions. Within the same period in the UK, construction activities related emission was the largest contributor to direct carbon emission (Huang et al. 2018). This indicates that the construction process carbon emission is quite substantial (Li et al. 2019) and must not be discounted if the industry’s goal of achieving net zero carbon by 2050 is to be attained (World GBC 2016).
Having established the significance of construction process carbon emission, the fragmented nature of construction operations (Fang et al. 2019) and the chaotic technique which characterizes the construction process (Yang et al. 2018) make it difficult to deploy strategies capable of lessening the impact of construction carbon footprint.

These challenges could slow the sector’s decarbonization which is urgently required due to its huge contribution to the global greenhouse gas emission (Giesekam et al. 2018). In view of this, this study seeks to investigate the critical barriers inhibiting the construction process carbon emission reduction. Although, given the complexity of built environment projects, various stakeholders such as architects, engineers, material suppliers and even clients are involved in its execution and they all have a role to play in its decarbonization. For example, the designers could substitute a high carbon-intensive material with low carbon intensive ones to lower a project’s total embodied carbon (Victoria and Perera 2018) and the client could adopt an early contractor involvement (ECI) contract model approach as a foresight strategy to take advantage of contractors’ carbon reduction experience to maximize the decarbonization potential of the asset to be built (Arogundade et al. 2021b). Nevertheless, if contractors who are responsible for utilizing these materials do not adopt them or do not share their experience, then the carbon reduction efforts by coming up with low-carbon materials or involving them from the project concept stage would have been wasted. Therefore, due to contractors’ vital role in bringing construction design to life (Cheung et al. 2012) and being the main stakeholder involved in the construction process stage of a project, they will be the major focus of this study. The findings of this study will arouse the interest of researchers and industry stakeholders as they become aware of specific barriers hindering construction stage decarbonization in the UK. This could then enable construction stakeholders to devise appropriate measures in overcoming the barriers.
Overview of carbon reduction barriers
The construction industry has been noted to be impervious to change (Tierney and Tennant 2015) and over time, contractors have been identified to be slow in implementing strategies capable of reducing carbon during construction projects (Wong et al. 2013). Some of the concerns highlighted in literature to be responsible for such behavioural tendencies by contractors are organizational and procedural barrier which according to Mohd-Rahim et al. (2017) represents a major obstacle in the development of green building. This lack of support from top management could equally be linked to the implementation cost of low-carbon technologies especially if there are no incentives for going green (Energy Research Partnership 2021; This is because most business leaders are concerned with the bottom-line and the need to ensure that the business continues to be in operation. However, if there is clear legislation enforcing the transition to green practices or utilization of low-carbon technologies (Salama and Hana 2010), the leaders of industry might consider it worthy to implement.
Upon legislating the adoption of low-carbon practices, the government will need to back such policy up by piloting it through public procurement frameworks to explore its practicability and to understand the financial implication to contractors (Ng 2015). This is because Ng (2015) have stated that contractors fear the jeopardisation of project success when looked at within the context of time, cost and quality that may arise as a result of utilizing unfamiliar or novel low-carbon construction equipment and/or materials. But if such risk is absorbed within the government’s tender, then contractors might be willing to infuse low-carbon plans in their bids and take the risk of implementing low-carbon practices during the execution of infrastructure projects. This could also address the situation of the lack of demand for low-carbon projects (Tierney and Tennant 2015). Tierney and Tennant (2015) narrated in their position paper exploring the major challenges confronting the delivery of low-carbon homes in Scotland that home buyers do not prioritize energy efficiency and are not willing to pay high prices to purchase such homes (Ng 2015; Salama and Hana 2010). A possible explanation for the high prices of low-carbon homes is the additional cost to be incurred for changing standard designs to introduce low-carbon technologies, engage the services of those with carbon reduction skills and purchase low-carbon materials (Tierney and Tennant 2015). The cost of hiring carbon reduction specialists and acquiring low-carbon materials leading to inflated construction prices could be due to the current insufficient knowledge of carbon minimization within the construction industry and reduced accessibility to low-carbon materials including construction equipment (Ng 2015).
Furthermore, Salama and Hana (2010) found in a study seeking to understand sustainable construction awareness levels amongst construction professionals in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) that the construction stakeholders ranked lack of awareness of the benefits of reducing carbon as the key challenge in implementing green building practices. This mirrors the report of the Energy Research Partnership (2021) which stated that adopting sustainable practices seems not to have any apparent competitive advantage for businesses in the UK. Other barriers highlighted by Salama and Hana (2010) include difficulty in quantifying carbon reduction benefits and the complex nature of construction. This could be due to the broader difficulty in identifying emission hotspots vis-a-vis the fragmented nature of the supply chain (Jackson and Kaesehage 2020). In line with this, the findings from the case study research conducted by Jackson and Kaesehage (2020) with participants from the UK construction sector revealed that having a procurement process stating the minimum carbon emission requirements as an industry standard can assist the sector with emission reduction. This is similar to the argument of Sanchez et al. (2015).
These barriers curated from different works and listed in Table 1 have generally been highlighted in the context of how it affects the whole construction industry. Hence, this study will be looking at how these barriers affect construction projects and most especially the ability of contractors to reduce the carbon footprints within their control in the UK.
Research method
The methodological model adopted in this study follows that of Chan et al. (2004) with some modifications. It comprises of literature review, questionnaire development, pilot study and empirical research (Figure 1).
The study began with a comprehensive review of the literature to provide a theoretical basis for the research and extract the initial set of carbon reduction barriers (Darko 2019). In extracting the barrier variables, a keyword search was done on the Scopus database. Scopus was chosen as it has been classified by researchers to be the most extensive database in the globe (Oliveros and Vaz-Serra 2018; Saad et al. 2023). Although, the search initially returned 136 papers but after filtering for relevance to the current study, only five papers were considered eligible to be utilized for developing the barrier variables. This could be as a result of the sparse research in the construction process carbon reduction study area (Arogundade et al. 2021b). Furthermore, scholars (Darko and Chan 2016; Arogundade et al. 2023) have noted that no single study can single-handedly address all the idiosyncratic complexities related to a research keyword when investigating a subject matter. Moreover, the number of papers utilized in this study for obtaining the barrier variables is similar to the number of papers used by Wong et al. (2013) in extracting the carbon reduction variable used for their investigation on contractors response to carbon reduction policies in construction projects. In view of this, the barrier variables obtained from the literature were collated in a questionnaire. For this study, the questionnaire included two other sections. The first section dealt with understanding the respondent’s participation in construction carbon minimization during the delivery of construction projects. This is necessary to ensure responses reflect the sector’s perception as it relates to carbon minimization barriers (Chan et al. 2004). The other section captures the profile of the respondents such as industry experience, experience related to carbon reduction, company type and job role. Upon completing the questionnaire development, 10 stakeholders with demonstrable years of experience in construction management were engaged for a pilot study. These stakeholders included two professors, an early career researcher and seven industry experts with knowledge of construction carbon reduction. The sample size of 10 for the pilot study was deemed sufficient since Ajayi (2016) opined that a 10–30 sample size is adequate for a pilot study. The questionnaire was examined for comprehensiveness, vagueness, relevance and suitability of terms used. Based on the valuable comments received from the professionals, the questionnaire was improved and a final list of 16 barrier variables was included in the survey questionnaire (Table 1). A five-point Likert scale (1 ¼ not critical, 2 ¼ less critical, 3 ¼ neutral, 4 ¼ critical, and 5 ¼ very critical) was used to obtain respondents’ views on the level of criticality of the barriers
