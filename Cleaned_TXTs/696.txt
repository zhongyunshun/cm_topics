The results of a survey of professional civil engineers working in the Australian construction industry are reported (n = 182). The survey examined the effect of a range of job and organizational demands on the marital or relationship satisfaction of respondents. The effect of demographic characteristics was also examined. The results of correlation and regression analyses provide support for linkages between demographic characteristics, job or organizational sources of work-related stress and marital/relationship satisfaction and con ict. Different variables were signi cantly correlated with three dimensions of relationship quality. The results suggest that the single most important factor in determining civil engineers’ experiences of relationship quality is the number of hours they work each week. It is argued that the implementation of work–life balance initiatives by engineering organizations may bene t employees. However, for such initiatives to be successful, engineering organizations and their employees must deviate from the socially constructed norm of rigid, long work hours that prevails in the Australian construction industry.
Construction, job demands, relationship satisfaction, relationship con ict, work–life balance
Introduction
Kanter (1977) suggested that the fate of both men and women is inextricably bound up with workplace structures and processes. The interface between the work and non-work experiences of people in paid employment has become an area of increasing concern as a result of the concurrent pressures associated with globalization and the dramatic changes to traditional family structures in most industrialized countries (Carnoy, 1999; Lobel et al., 1999). Research has demonstrated that workers’ occupational contexts in uence the level of perceived con ict between work and non-work experiences (O’Neil and Greenberger, 1994), including perceptions of marital or relationship quality (Hughes et al., 1992). Many of the job and organizational factors associated with low levels of marital or relationship
satisfaction or high levels of marital or relationship con ict are likely to be pertinent to the work of construction industry professionals.
The construction industry is a demanding work environment in which participants are expected to work long hours. A recent survey of Australian engineers found that 44% of respondents work 45 hours per week or more, and 21% work over 50 hours. Of those working more than 50 hours per week, 67% expressed a preference for working fewer hours (APESMA, 2000). Research suggests that long work hours are negatively related to family participation and positively related to divorce rate (Aldous et al., 1979). The APESMA survey did not examine the impact of hours on relationship satisfaction or con ict, but did  nd that 34% of respondents indicated some dif culty in taking accrued leave entitlements, and 33% expressed dissatisfaction on the balance between work and family.
Construction industry employees are also required to

work non-standard work schedules, including weekend work. Irregularity of work hours has been identi ed as the most important variable affecting low marital quality among shift workers (White and Keith, 1990) and non-standard work schedules have been found to affect separation or divorce rate among married people with children (Presser, 2000).
Furthermore, the industry is project-based and job security may be lower than in repetitive process industries, since continued employment is conditional on successful tendering for new projects in a highly competitive environment. Previous research has found job insecurity to be negatively related to marital and family functioning (Larson et al., 1994). Job insecurity has also been identi ed as a determinant of burnout, for which there is a direct crossover effect from husbands to their wives (Westman et al., 2002). Continued employment in the construction industry may require frequent relocation, with the consequence that an increasing number of dual career couples participate in ‘commuter marriages’. People engaged in commuter marriages have reported signi cantly less satisfaction with partner and family life than people in single-residence families or relationships (Bunker et al., 1992).
There are compelling reasons why the construction industry should be concerned with the impact of its demands on the quality of participants’ experiences outside work. Both men and women have been found to experience home-to-work ‘spillover’ effects, whereby subjective experiences in one context impact upon performance in the other arena (Eckenrode and Gore, 1990; Barnett, 1994). A recent study by Adams et al. (1996) found that when work interferes with family life it also reduces the satisfaction from job and from life as a whole. Furthermore, this spillover effect is bidirectional, and the impact of home events on behaviour in the workplace has implications for organizational performance. In this context, research also suggests that the implementation of family-friendly work policies and practices leads to enhanced organizational ef ciency, morale and productivity (Baden and Friedman, 1981; Fernandez, 1986; Butruille, 1990; Cass, 1993). Further research suggests that the quality of family and marital life moderates the impact of job role quality on psychological distress (Barnett et al., 1992). Thus, workers with positive subjective experience of family and marital life are less likely to suffer mental health problems as a result of work-related stress. From a social policy perspective, Australia’s rati cation of ILO Convention 156 in 1990 obliges Australia to aim to enable employees with family responsibilities to work without discrimination or con ict between work and family (Cass, 1993). This commitment is re ected in a growing body of legislation imposing requirements on employers in respect of the family responsibilities of employees (Napoli, 1994).
The results presented in this paper are preliminary results in an on-going research project investigating work, family and employees’ well-being in the Australian construction industry. In particular, this paper seeks to identify the effect of different job and organizational characteristics prevalent in the construction industry on the perceptions of marital or relationship satisfaction and con ict among a sample of practising civil engineers. Initially, a pilot study of civil engineers has been undertaken to trial the data collection and measurement methodology. However, it is intended that the full-scale study will not be restricted to one occupational group and will investigate the experiences of all categories of supervisory, professional and support workers in the Australian construction industry. Also, the follow-up study is to measure a greater number of variables, including work–life con ict and the bi-directional ‘spillover’ effect. Nevertheless, the results presented in this paper provide new and revealing information on the link between job demands and relationship quality in the construction industry. The effects of demographic characteristics identi ed in the literature to be associated with work–life con ict, such as age, parental status and age of youngest child, are also considered in this paper.
Sample and procedures
The data for this study were obtained from civil engineers engaged in professional practice in consulting and contracting organizations in New South Wales and Victoria. Of the respondents, 92.3% were male (thus 7.7% were female), 45.1% were under and 54.9% were over 35 years of age, and 35.2% were between 25 and 34 years of age. Most respondents were married (65.4%). A further 17.6% of respondents indicated they were in a relationship, while 15.9% of respondents were single and 1.1% indicated that they were divorced. Under half (48.6%) of respondents reported that they had no children, while 36.4% had either two or three children and 10.5% had one child. Respondents were predominantly employed in consulting  rms (84.6%). Only 11% of respondents indicated they worked for a contracting organization and only 1.6% reported working for a supplier. Re ecting this, 81.3% of respondents indicated that they spent most of their time at work in an of ce environment, with 7% reporting that they were site based, and 10.4% indicating that their job involved both of ce and site work.
Marital/relationship satisfaction among Australian engineers	509
In the  rst instance, a register of companies employing civil engineers was obtained from the Institution of Engineers, Australia. General managers or human resources managers of listed companies were approached and asked whether the company would participate in the study. At this stage, the managers were thoroughly briefed on the objectives of the study. Questionnaires were randomly distributed through the internal mail systems of the companies that agreed to participate. Completed questionnaires were returned directly to the researchers in unmarked postage-paid envelopes provided for this purpose. Each questionnaire was distributed with a copy of a plain language statement describing the objectives of the study. The statement also explained the voluntary nature of respondent participation and assured anonymity of respondents and con dentiality of responses. Of 500 questionnaires distributed, 182 completed and usable ones were returned, yielding a response rate of 36%.
Demographic information collected from each respondent included each respondent’s age, gender, relationship status, number of children and, where applicable, the age of the youngest child. The employment status of the respondent’s partner was requested in order to identify differences between employees in dual- and singleincome households. Information was also collected about a respondent’s current job, including the job title, their typical work location (e.g. site or of ce based) and the average number of hours he or she works each week. Respondents were also asked to indicate the size of their employing organization and the nature of the work undertaken by this company (e.g. consulting or contracting).
Organizational and job conditions (stressors), identi ed in the literature to be associated with occupational stress (see e.g. Cooper and Marshall, 1976; Mauno and Kinnunen, 1999), were measured using a 36-item instrument. This instrument was designed speci cally for assessing environmental sources of managerial

Table 1	Descriptive statistics for the job demands variables
The scale was designed to tap dimensions likely to be relevant to the work of construction industry professionals, such as the effect of work schedule demands and responsibility for others. Twelve subscales were measured, including responsibility, role ambiguity, role con ict, subjective quantitative workload, participation in decision-making, uncertainty, control over work pace, working with others, relationship with coworkers and satisfaction with pay, promotion prospects and job security. Items were taken from several previously deployed instruments, including the Michigan Organizational Assessment Questionnaire (Cook et al., 1981). Respondents were asked to rate items on a Likert-type scale ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 7 (strongly agree). Owing to the fact that this scale was developed using items from several existing scales, the results were factor analyzed. Following factor analysis, 23 items were retained. Table 1 provides descriptive statistics for the job demands subscales. As can be seen, the Cronbach’s alpha coef cients for the social satisfaction and satisfaction with promotion prospects subscales were rather low and, accordingly, the results associated with these variables should be treated with caution.
Marital satisfaction and con ict were measured using an 18-item instrument developed by Orden and Bradburn (1968). This instrument asks respondents to rate the frequency with which they had engaged in nine satisfying activities or experienced con ict in nine key aspects of their relationship with their partner during the past few weeks.
Factor analysis was performed to establish the discriminant validity of the marital quality variables. It was expected that, because the scale had been used previously by its authors and found to have good psychometric properties, a two-factor model representing satisfaction and con ict would emerge. However, in our sample, principal components analysis with varimax rotation yielded a three-factor structure for marital quality that accounted for 59% of the total variance overall. The  rst component had an eigenvalue of 5.8 and accounted for 32.4% of variance, the second had an eigenvalue of 3.5 and accounted for 19.4% of variance and the third component had an eigenvalue of 1.3 and accounted for 7.4% of variance in the model. Table 2 shows the results of this analysis. A minimum factor loading of 0.50 was used when considering an item to load on a particular factor. An examination of the items showed that the items designed to measure relationship satisfaction loaded on two separate factors. The wording of the items suggested that these two factors differed in terms of whether the satisfaction was derived from interaction between the two partners, for example, eating out together at a restaurant, or from interacting with others as a couple, for example, entertaining friends in their home. These two dimensions of marital quality were labelled ‘relationship satisfaction’ and ‘social relations’, respectively. In order to remain consistent with Orden and Bradburn’s (1968) interpretation of the scale, these factors were interpreted to measure satisfaction with two qualitatively different aspects of an interpersonal relationship. Perceived marital con ict was represented by a single factor. As may be noted, there was minimal problem with double loading of items, which attests to the discriminant validity of the variables.
Pearson product moment correlations of variables used in the study are reported in Table 3. Signi cant correlates differed between the three dimensions of relationship quality, and included both demographic and job/organizational demands. Of the demographics, age (r = –0.325, p<0.001), number of children (r = –0.345, p<0.001) and tenure (r = –0.346, p<0.001) were negatively correlated with relationship satisfaction. Age (r = –0.170, p<0.01) and tenure (r = –0.179, p<0.01) were also negatively correlated with relationship con ict. Of the job/organizational demands variables, hours worked per week (r = –0.223, p<0.01), perceived overload (r = –0.175, p<0.01) and responsibility (r = –0.184, p<0.01) were negatively correlated with relationship satisfaction. Hours worked per week (r = 0.244, p<0.01) and role con ict experienced in the work context (r = 0.236, p<0.01) were positively correlated with relationship con ict. Satisfaction with pay (r = –0.219, p<0.01) was negatively correlated with relationship con ict. Only one variable, satisfaction with promotion prospects (r = 0.214, p<0.05), was correlated signi cantly with the social relations dimension of relationship quality, and this correlation was relatively weak.
One-way ANOVA tests were conducted to determine whether perceived relationship quality differed by gender, marital status or parental demands. There were no signi cant differences in perceived relationship quality among men and women. The difference between the perceived relationship con ict or social relations between respondents who were married and those who indicated that they were ‘involved’ were not signi cant. However, married respondents reported a signi cantly lower level of relationship satisfaction than those who were ‘involved’ (F = 15.559, p = 0.000). In considering the effect of parental demands, comparisons were made between parents and non-parents. An independent samples t-test revealed no signi cant differences in relationship

con ict or social relations between respondents with children and those without children. However, relationship satisfaction was signi cantly higher among non-parents compared with parents (t = 5.560, p = 0.000). Parental demands were also coded by age of a respondent’s youngest child. The one-way ANOVA indicated that relationship satisfaction and social relations were not signi cantly related to the age of a respondent’s youngest child. However, relationship con ict was signi cantly related to age of youngest child (F = 3.585, p = 0.009). Respondents whose youngest child was an infant or teenager reported higher levels of relationship con ict than those whose youngest child was primary school-age or over 18. Differences between respondents who reported spending their time in different work contexts were also tested, because previous research has found work context to be signi cantly related to con ict between work and family (Wallace, 1999). The difference in relationship satisfaction and social relations was not signi cantly different for respondents who worked on site or in the of ce. However, relationship con ict was found to be higher for site-based than for of ce-based engineers, and this difference was found to be signi cant (F = 3.993, p = 0.021).
To test the predictive ability of these relationships, a stepwise multiple regression analysis was conducted. Because of the large number of independent variables, only those demographic and job/organizational demand variables that were signi cantly correlated with the relationship quality variables were included in the regression model for each dimension of relationship satisfaction. In all cases, relevant demographic variables, such as age, were entered into the regression model before job demands to ensure that these variables were ‘controlled’, and any effects attributed to job demands occurred over and above the effect of demographic variables. The results of this regression analysis are presented in Table 4.
Generally the amount of variability ‘explained’ by the regression models was relatively small. The models accounted for 16% of variability in relationship satisfaction, 14% in relationship con ict and only 5% in social relations. The beta coef cients indicate that some demographic and job/organizational demands are signi cant predictors of relationship quality. Signi cant predictors of relationship satisfaction included tenure (b = –0.333, p = 0.000) and hours worked per week (b = –0.188, p = 0.018). Signi cant predictors of relationship con ict were hours worked each week (b = 0.206, p = 0.011), satisfaction with pay (b =
–0.212, p = 0.008) and role con ict at work (b = 0.194, p = 0.017). Only one independent variable, promotion prospects, yielded a signi cant beta coef cient for social relations (b = 0.214, p = 0.011).
Clearly the correlations in Table 3 are meaningful and provide support for linkages between demographic characteristics, job or organizational sources of workrelated stress and marital/relationship satisfaction and con ict. Different variables were signi cantly correlated with the three dimensions of relationship quality. Perceived subjective overload, responsibility and the number of children were found to be negatively correlated with lower levels of relationship satisfaction. These variables relate to demands on a person’s resources both at work and at home. The correlations suggest that, as the demands on an individual’s resources increase, the less satis ed he or she will be in marital or relationship life. Interestingly, these variables were not signi cantly correlated with relationship con ict, suggesting that sources of relationship satisfaction and con ict are different.
One interpretation for the correlation with relationship satisfaction but not con ict could be linked to

couples’ coping strategies. Thus, the individual may discuss problems experienced at work or at home with his/her partner, which may serve to inhibit the extent to which con icts arise. Demands that prohibit participation in home life and therefore reduce relationship satisfaction do not lead to higher levels of con ict between partners. In a similar manner, Mauno and Kinnunen (1999) suggested that partners can provide emotional support for the relief of negative reactions evoked by a stressful work day.
Alternatively, this effect may be an artefact of the gender composition of the sample. The overwhelming majority of survey respondents were male, many of whom were involved in ‘two-person, single-career’ partnerships in which both members of a married or de facto couple work together to ful l the demands of the husband’s job. Both partners in such families devote their resources to supporting the career of one partner. In such circumstances, it is reasonable to expect that increasing demands could result in lower relationship satisfaction for the individual experiencing them, without being a source of con ict for the couple.
Work-related role con ict was found to be associated with con ict in an engineer’s relationship with spouse or partner. Role con ict occurs at work when two or more job demands cannot be met simultaneously. Typically the management of construction projects involves a trade-off between cost, time and quality. Added to these are safety and environmental imperatives and the threat of personal liability in the event of unforeseen incidents. In this environment, role con ict is likely to be high. Indeed, Bacharach et al. (1991) suggested that, for engineers, role con ict (e.g. con ict between professional standards and budget constraints) may be more strongly associated with more severe, ‘life and death’ consequences than in other occupational groups. Our  ndings suggest that there may be a ‘spillover’ effect between con ict at work and con ict at home. Thus, the existence and severity of role con ict in the workplace is an important area for work–life balance research in the construction industry.
It is important to note that much of the research on the effects of work on experiences in other areas of one’s life has focused on the experiences of working women. Our sample is somewhat unusual in that it is predominantly male. Our  ndings are consistent with those studies that have examined the experiences of both men and women in that they suggest that it is not only women who experience dif culties balancing commitments in their work and non-work life, and that gender differences in work experiences are minor and diminishing (Mauno and Kinnunen, 1999). In some cases, men have reported more acute dif culties than women. For example, Wallace (1999) found that male lawyers actually reported higher levels of time-based con ict, in which the time pressures associated with work interfere with time spent with family, than their female counterparts. Furthermore, the more hours that men worked the more they felt that their work invaded their non-work life.
Traditionally, men have performed the ‘breadwinner’ role in family life. Despite the fact that women’s education levels and participation in paid employment continue to increase, recent research suggests that married couples still assign more income-earning responsibility to the husband (Gorman, 1999). Gorman also suggested that this assignment leads married men to pursue higher earnings goals than single men, and shapes their behaviour in deciding to remain in an existing job or seek a new employment opportunity. She also suggested that married men may work longer hours and devote more effort to their work. It is possible that the predominantly male respondents in our sample view their work in this light and that this view contributes to the reduced relationship satisfaction reported by some respondents. In particular, married respondents with children, who may be presumed to experience the highest degree of ‘breadwinner’ responsibility, report signi cantly lower relationship satisfaction than involved or single respondents without children.
The ‘breadwinner’ proposition is also consistent with the positive correlation observed between satisfaction with pay and relationship con ict. It is possible that respondents’ justi cation for working long hours and weekends is that they are ‘bringing home the bacon’, but that con ict arises where partners perceive pay to be insuf cient to justify this level of job involvement. Dissatisfaction with pay emerged as an important theme in qualitative data provided by many of the respondents in a space provided at the end of the questionnaire. A recurrent theme in these comments was a sense of frustration that professional engineers do not enjoy remuneration commensurate with their contribution to society. More work is needed to investigate this issue. In particular, experiences of both partners in a relationship need to be considered. However, it is possible that excessive work involvement that is justi ed in terms of ful lment of the ‘breadwinner’ role exacerbates the negative effect of work on relationship quality.
Age and tenure
Respondents’ age and tenure, expressed as the number of years that they had worked in their current employment, were both signi cantly correlated with relationship satisfaction and con ict. Unexpectedly, the relationship with both of these dependent variables was in the negative direction. Thus, as age and tenure increase, both relationship satisfaction and relationship con ict decrease. One possible explanation for this  nding is that, over time, couples adjust to lower the level of satisfaction they expect to derive from their relationships. Alternatively, these  ndings could lend further support to the ‘male breadwinner’ theory described above, since trends in workforce demographics suggest that older employees are more likely to participate in ‘two-person, single-career’ families than younger employees.

The correlations and regression analyses suggest that the single most important factor in determining civil engineers’ experiences of relationship quality is the number of hours they work each week. Engineers’ concern with work hours they perceive to be excessive is evident from the APESMA (2000) study cited in the introduction to this paper. Furthermore, the objective number of hours worked seems to be a more important determinant of relationship quality than subjective overload. This  nding is inconsistent with previous research  ndings. For example, Crouter et al. (2001) found that couples do not evaluate relationships less positively when men work longer hours but, when men suffer from subjective role overload, partners’ evaluations of relationship quality are less positive. Wallace (1999) also found subjective feelings of excessive workload to be more important determinants of work to nonwork con ict than the actual number of hours worked.
These inconsistent results may be due partly to the industry from which the samples were drawn. For example, Wallace’s (1999) study comprised a single industry (lawyers) and she concluded that, for lawyers, overload may have more serious consequences than hours because lawyers enjoy a signi cant degree of control over their work schedules. This control serves to minimize the potential for time-based work to nonwork con ict. It is likely that where professionals do not enjoy such control, long hours will be more damaging. Our  ndings may therefore re ect the fact that civil engineers in Australia do not have a great deal of control over their work schedule.
Work–life balance initiatives
The results of the study suggest that work-related role stress is related to the relationship quality experienced by Australian civil engineers. This study does not explore the mechanism by which this effect occurs.
There are different theoretical interpretations of the impact of work on relationship quality. Some theorists believe that the relationship is direct, in that high involvement in work discourages high involvement in one’s relationship. For example, Hochschild (1997) suggested that a danger for parents with ‘desirable’ jobs is that they come to feel more appreciated and competent at work than at home. The consequence of this is that home comes to feel like a ‘workplace’ characterized by the need to ful l mundane chores. Other theories hold that the relationship is indirect, and the effect of work stressors on relationship quality being mediated by the individual’s perception of work–family con ict or emotional well-being (Bedeian et al., 1988; Mauno and Kinnunen, 1999). Yet other theories suggest that employees suffering from work–family con ict  nd it dif cult to interact in a nurturant manner with their partner. For example, Matthews et al. (1996) suggested that work–family con ict affects marital quality through lowered marital warmth and supportiveness. Now that our study has con rmed that job demands are related to relationship quality, future research should explore the validity of different theoretical explanations for this linkage.
Whatever the mechanism, our results suggest that construction industry professionals in Australia experience some interference between work and their nonwork life. Ways to mitigate this interference should be considered. Increasing compensation through paying higher salaries may not be the answer. This may reduce some sources of relationship con ict but is unlikely to improve the relationship satisfaction of industry participants. Research suggests that exaggerated compensation systems increase employees’ belief that they must continue their involvement in an organization because the personal costs of leaving are high. This leads to a sense of being ‘trapped’, which would not bene t the individual and has a limited effect on organizationally valued outcomes (Mellor et al., 2001).
By contrast, there is evidence that the provision of other work–life balance initiatives, such as  extime or childcare/eldercare services pays greater dividends in terms of increasing employees’ commitment to the organization and yields bene cial outcomes for both the individual and organization (Perry-Smith and Blum, 2000).
However, construction industry organizations need to pay close attention to the types of work–life balance initiatives they provide. Research suggests that employees who ful l different roles in their non-work environments, for example parents compared with nonparents, will have different experiences at the work–life interface (Vinokur et al., 1999). This suggests that different employees will value different initiatives and that their needs will change over time. In the context of an increasingly diverse workforce and the changing nature of family structures, employees’ non-work obligations will take many different forms. Helping employees to meet these obligations will require more  exible ‘cafeteria-style’ bene t programmes that can be suited to individual and changing needs. In deciding what to provide and how to provide it,  rms should seek to meet the needs of key constituent employee groups (Bardoel et al., 1999).
Finally, in considering the possible bene cial effects of work–life balance initiatives, the widely reported lack of take-up of such initiatives, particularly by men (Haas and Hwang, 1995), must be noted. It is likely that this poor take-up is related to traditional gendered assumptions about separation of family and home
and division of labour that result in greater valuing of male employees or those without family commitments. Lewis (2001) argued that only in the context of dramatic cultural change will the negative effects of work on non-work experiences be overcome. It could be argued that the need for cultural change is particularly acute in the construction industry. If the negative impact of work demands on the relationship satisfaction of employees is to be curtailed, construction organizations and their individual employees will need to deviate from the socially constructed norm of rigid, long work hours that predominates in the construction industry.
Our results suggest that aspects of working life experienced by Australian civil engineers have a damaging effect on the quality of their personal relationships outside work. Furthermore, different aspects of work and demographic characteristics are related to relationship satisfaction and con ict. In the light of research linking work–family issues to organizational performance and Australia’s strong social policy commitment to work–life balance, this situation is unhealthy. Arguments for assisting employees to better balance their work and non-work life abound. Our results suggest that the Australian construction industry should examine its methods of working and consider ways to create a productive workplace that is also supportive of employees’ non-work responsibilities.
The limitations of the study must be acknowledged. First, the cross-sectional design of the study limits the inferences that can be drawn from its results. While an attempt is made to identify the effects of demographic and work-related variables on relationship quality, longitudinal data would enable causal relationships between variables to be identi ed. Second, the analysis was limited to a single profession, namely civil engineers. Some of the  ndings reported may be limited to this profession or to engineers in general. It is important to determine whether the results are generalizable to more professionally diverse groups of men and women. Research, examining a broader range of variables among a sample of employees from other professions involved in the construction industry is on-going. This research will include a qualitative component in which in-depth interviews will be conducted with a sub-set of the sample. This will provide a better understanding of the social construction of work and family experiences and the meaning participants place on the satisfaction they derive from work and family life. Finally, several key variables were not considered. The effect of working away from home was not measured in the study and future research should address this issue as it is likely to have an impact on relationship quality. Also, owing to the under-representation of contractor-based engineers in our sample, no meaningful comparison between employees’ experiences in contractor and consulting  rms was possible. However, job demands experienced by contractors’ employees are different from those of consultants. For example, most employees of contractors are required to work a six-day week, while consultants typically work a  ve-day week. Future research should attempt to obtain more data from engineers working in contracting  rms as well, so that comparisons can be made.
