Quality in Construction Management: An Exploratory Study
Introduction
6 	Jung and Wang (2006) and Lam and Thomas (2006) stated that top managers have been
8 focusing on the need for applying quality philosophies to achieve high performance levels
9 among various components and procedures. There has been increased interest within the
11 	construction management community in exploring possibilities for applying quality knowledge
13 gained from manufacturing and other industrial sectors to the problems of managing the 14 construction process (Abdel Salam and Gad, 2009). Unfortunately, contractors rarely have a
16 	realistic idea of how much profit they are losing by not attaining an acceptable level of quality.
18 Turk (2006) stated that quality may sometimes be ignored in the construction industry in order to 19 cut the costs and shorten the project duration. However, it is believed that the benefits of higher 20
21 	customer satisfaction, better quality products, and higher market share are often obtained
23 following the adoption of quality by construction companies (Pheng and Teo, 2004).
24 events in developing countries coupled with restructuring of economics, emergence of the world
26 	trade organization and the rising price of oil are expected to yield an unprecedented growth in
28 constructions. Consequently, a huge number of large scale projects are currently in planning and
29 contract awarding phase (Wanberg et al., 2013). The construction industry has experienced
31 	growth during the boom that occurred in developing countries in the last decade encouraging
33 investments in the industry and raising the importance of deploying management philosophies 34 advancement to this industrial segment. The effects of quality on a business are numerous and
36 have improved the productivity of design and project management and now have become vital to 37
38 	construction business to survive and have a competitive edge.
40 	In response, this paper explores the factors affecting quality in construction management 41
42 (housing sector) in a developing country (Jordan). Jordan is looking to develop a better
43 management strategy for its construction projects, and this is a priority for other developing 44
45 	countries too (JEA, 2013). Our aim in this paper is to identify the relative importance of factors
47 affecting quality in the Jordanian housing sector. This study addresses the following research 48 objectives: (1) to identify the factors affecting quality in the housing sector, (2) to examine the
50 relative importance (e.g. highest and lowest) of such factors from the view point of architects 51
52 	and contractors, and (3) to develop an integrated conceptual framework for quality factors.
54 	The rest of this paper is structured as follows: quality, quality in construction, and factors
56 	affecting quality in the literature are reviewed, the research methodology is discussed, findings 57
58 	and discussion follows, and the final section includes conclusions and contributions.
2.1 Quality
The success of a project found in the literature depends on the project quality as a key concept
7 (Wanberg et al., 2013, Romeo et al., 2014). Arditi and Gunaydin, (1997) define the concept of
8 quality as meeting the legal, aesthetic and functional requirements of a project. Eng and Yousef
10 	(2003) explain quality as both a philosophy and a set of guiding principles that represents a
12 	continuously improving organization. Quality can be translated into the quality dimensions that 13 	include: levels    of    quality,    reliability   and   safety,    quality   performance,    durability, and
17 Wang (2006) argue that it is the role of management to ensure the achievement of established
18 requirements in a project as competition increases and change occurs in the business world.
20 	Understanding how closely the project conforms to its requirements, a high quality project can
22 be described by such terms as ease in understanding drawings, level of conflict in drawings and
23 specifications, construction economy, ease of operation and maintenance, and energy efficiency
25 	(Ardti and Gunaydin, 1997). According to Al Nofal et al., (2005) and Jraisat and Sawalha
27 (2013), quality requires radical change to traditional management practices. Quality is one of the
28 most complex practices for any company; it requires implementing a new way of managing
30 	business and culture which not only affects the whole organizational process and employees but 31
32 	also the allocation of significant resources (Santos et al., 2002; Jung, 2009).
35 	Quality needs control which is the specific implementation&  of the quality assurance program.
37 Effective control for quality reduces the possibilities of change,Reliab mistakes and omissions, which
38 in turn result in fewer conflicts and disputes. Most of the engineers and architects were in total
40 	control during the design phase. During the construction phase, they carried out a role described
42 as 'supervision', insuring that the owner received his money's worth in terms of quality.
43 Recently, owners became increasingly concerned with cost and schedule, areas where design
45 professionals were not providing good control. Engineers and architects must work together to
46 47 	achieve specified goals of quality and liability control, recognizing that each person and each

48 	activity affects and in turn is affected by others. As competition increases and changes occur in
50 	the business world, companies look for high levels of effectiveness across all functions and
52 	processes and choose quality management as a strategy to stay in the business.
2.2 Quality in Construction
In a construction project, quality management has been widely used by world-class companies to
4 	ensure 	successful 	projects 	delivery 	(Aichouni 	et al., 2014). The 	interactions 	and 5
6 	interrelationships  between  key  participants  (e.g.  the  client,  the  architect  and  the  contractor)
8 ournalargely  determine  the  overall  performance  of  the  construction  project. Notwithstanding  this 7
9 mutual dependency, the performance of individual participants remains important because the
11 	l overall performance is a function of the performance of each participant (Soetanto and Proverbs,
Lianying and Weijie, 2013). According to Rwelamila and Wisemant (1995), Arditi and
14 Gunaydin (1997), Turk (2006) and Saeed and Hasan, (2012), quality in the construction industry
1516  	can be defined as meeting the requirements of the designer, constructor and regulatory agencies
18 as well as the owner. Based on the three studies above, quality can be characterized based on
19 meeting the requirementsof of the  owner (e.g. functional adequacy, completion time, budget;
23 information prior to design, provisions for decisions by owner and design professional,Qualit	 and 22
24 contracting to perform work), constructor (e.g. contract plans, specifications, timely decisions,
26 	and  contracting 	to performy work),  and regulatory agencies (e.g. public safety and health,
28 environmental considerations, protection of public property, and laws and regulations).
29 Moreover, one should also differentiate between product quality (the physical product itself) and
31 	the process quality (the activities that causes the product to be either acceptable or not) in a
33 project (Culp et al., 1993). For example, "product quality" in the construction industry may refer
34 to achieving quality in the materials, equipment and technology&  that go into a structure building,
36 	where "process quality" may refer to achieving quality in theReliab way the project is managed in the
38 three main phases of construction process which are planning and designing phase, construction
39 phase, and operation and maintenance phase (Burati and Oswald, 1993; Arditi and Gunaydin,
44 The construction industry and its quality presently are facing urgency of shaping a sustainable 45 construction process (Zhai et al., 2014).The role of quality in construction has been emphasized
47 	by the use of various aspects of quality tools and techniques (e.g. Metri, 2005).
49 organizations are frustrated in their effort to improve quality because these companiesity have  48
50 exclusively focused on financial measures instead of quality measures (Torbica and Stroh, 1999;
52 	Sharmma and Gudanne, 2002). Construction firms, therefore, need to understand the quality
54 factors for their success in order to establish quality factors for construction firms (Saeed Mand  53
55 Hasan, 2012). Although quality has been widely implemented in the Japanese construction
57 	industry since the 1980s and in the American construction field since the 1990s, it has not yet
59 	been implemented successfully in developing countries (Abdel-Razek, 1998; Hiyassat, 2000; 60 	Kazaz et al., 2004; Abdel Salam and Gad, 2009). Many studies have demonstrated that project
management action is a key element in achieving quality in construction. The success of quality
management depends heavily on management practices. These practices include: motivation by
the contractor’s senior management, commitment of top managers to site management (Abdel-  Razek, 1998; Kaye and Anderson, 1999), and integration of continuous improvement activities
67 	into the strategic goals across the whole organization, across boundaries and at all levels (Kaye
9 	and Anderson, 1999). Contractors, for example, need to define their objectives by creating a
10 	harmony through mutual co-ordination among all parties (Asim et al., 2013).
13 	According to Kazaz and Birgonul (2005), Turk (2006) and Haseeb et al., (2011), construction
15 firms have some deficiencies in getting stability in a quality concept when their business 16 structures use temporary labors and change their location constantly and consequently.

1718  	Furthermore, construction projects are widely seen as unpredictable in terms of delivery time,
20 budget, profitability and the standards of quality expected (Love et al., 2000). Some differences
21 must be considered when applying a quality program to construction projects (Arditi and
2223  	Gunaydin, 1997; Pheng andQualit Teo, 2004; Romeo et al., 2014). These differences illustrate that
25 almost all construction projects are single order-production products, each construction
26 production site always displaysy different  conditions; the life-cycle of a construction project is
28 	much longer than the life-cycle of most manufactured products, and there is no uniform standard
30 in evaluating overall construction quality. Thus, construction projects usually are evaluated 31 subjectively, and the participants in the construction project (e.g. owner, designer, general 3233  contractor, subcontractor, material supplier, etc.) differ for each project.
36 2.3 Factors Affecting Quality in Construction Management Reliab
39 	In  construction  projects,  there  is  a  need  for  a  framework  for  evaluating  quality  to  assist
40 	construction clients in selecting quality-oriented organizations that will provide higher quality
42 products and processes within budget and on schedule (Idrus and Sodangi, 2010, Dina et al.,
Porter and Parker (1993) stated that in managing quality, some organizations focus on
4445  	specific areas such as training, leadership, and benchmarking while others take a holistic
47 	approach for quality factors. Haupt and Whiteman (2004) have conducted a study in the U.S.A
4950  commitment and involvement, customer satisfaction, planning, participative managementity style,  48 through a literature review and a survey of contractors to identify factors (e.g. management
52 continuous improvement measurement, rewards for quality contribution, and training of M
53 workers) affecting the operations of a construction jobsite. Pheng and Hong (2005) have done a
5455  	study in Singapore which involved the participation of project managers in the construction
57 industry. A survey was used and the respondents generated eight factors and the relative
58 importance of each factor was determined. For example, the first factor in order of priority was 59
60 	total commitment .Second, was strategic quality management, and followed by customer-driven
service, eliminating rework, teamwork, and training, empowering and respecting people. Furthermore, Lam et al. (2008) have explored the extent of quality in Hong Kong large-sized
public building contractors. They concluded that the contractors should pay more attention first to the factors of strategic planning, human resources management, and leadership in order to
67	attain the goal of continuous improvement then to the factors of process management, customer
9 	and market focus, measurement, and analysis and knowledge management.
12 Previous  studies  highlighted  the  factors  affecting  the  quality  of  construction. Each  study has
13 contributed  to  identifying  some  factors  affecting  quality. However,  there  are  few  published
15 works that comprehensively address the factors specifically affecting the quality of construction
16 in different parts of the world. Researchers still differ in their perceptions as to what should be
1718  	emphasized most among the different factors affecting quality. Moreover, few studies have been
20 conducted in the Middle East regions that are addressing quality factors in construction.
21 Fourteen quality frameworks for construction industry have been promoted by different authors,
2223  	for the purpose of establishing construction quality factors in this study. A detailed analysisQualit	 of
24 25 	the frameworks is carried out and presented in Table 1.
Analysis of Quality Frameworks
31 A  careful balance  between  the  owners  requirements  of the  project costs and  schedules, desired
32 operating  characteristics,  materials  of  construction,  etc.  and  the  adequate  time  and  budget to
34 	meet those requirements during the design process is essential. Owners  balance  their
37 constructor is responsible for the means, methods, techniques, sequencesReliab, and procedures of
39 construction, as well as safety precautions and programs during the construction process. Project 41 requirements are the key factors that define quality in the process of construction. After a review il
42 	of  the literature on quality factors in construction,  it appears that not all the factors have the
44 	same frequency and importance but they complement one another. Accordingly, relying on the
46 previous research findings about factors affecting quality in construction, this study uses  13
47 quality factors as the most relevant. Table 2 lists the most important factors  and  literature
49 	support, where definitions of the factors are provided.
A List of Quality Factors and Literature Support 52 	M
Due to the dearth of real data relating to quality in the Jordanian housing projects, the
researchers use an exploratory method to identify the most  related quality factors. The present
7 	aim of this study was  identified: factors affecting quality in the  Jordanian housing sector and
9 their relative importance. This exploratory research includes two phases of extensive  review of
10 the literature and a survey questionnaire by personal interviews in the housing sector in Jordan.
12 The research design started with identifying a research problem, and then it provided a review of
14 the available literature in order to understand previous research in quality and relevant fields. 15 This has led to a determination of the key aim and objectives, and then providing the initial 16 17 conceptual framework for quality factors.

The survey was conducted by means of structured personal interviews within two months
21 	(September and October, 2013), carried out face to face for checking the information accuracy,
23 and developing an understandingQualit of quality factors based on the designed questionnaire.
24 the interviews, interviewees were briefed on research problem, research objectives and quality
26 	factors. The interviews were conducted at the premises of the selected companies that agreedy 	 to
28 participate. The questionnaires were answered by contractors and architects who were in charge
29 of quality awareness to ensure that the respondent has the necessary knowledge to respond.
31 	the companies included in the survey were located in Amman due the constraints of time and
Amman is considered to be the main economic hub of the country, and 77 % of the housing
34 projects are concentrated there (JEA, 2013).Most of the survey questions were adopted from
36 	previous literature that had been used to determine the factors affecting quality in  construction.
38 	The questionnaire was made of two parts: the demographic information of respondents  and Reliab
41 measure on a five-point likert scale to ensure consistency and the ease of data computation. The il quality factors. The importance of factors affecting quality was measured using a perceptual

46 	important to have a valid instrument for measurement, so the process of developing the

48 	questionnaire ended with a pre-test, which were used to modify and eliminate a number of
However, it was found to be valid on the basis of our study. The list of ISO 9000
50 51 	certified companies (as of June, 2013) was obtained from Jordan Institution for Standards and
53 Metrology. This list contained the name, telephone and fax number and the certification body for
283 certified firms in Jordan. Of these firms, only four of them  are  construction  firms.
56 	Companies that were  ISO 9000 certified were  used in the population to capture the benefits and
58 	to ensure the maturity of the system in the firms.
An exploratory pilot study was conducted at Jordanian Engineering Association (JEA), Jordan Construction Contractors Association (JCCA), Ministry of Public Work and Housing, Ministry
of Industry and Trade (MIT), to seek out detailed information regarding the potential
participants constituting the housing sector in Jordan. The population of the study consists of
67	working contractors and architects in the Jordanian housing sector obtained from the lists of
9 	JEA, JCCA and MIT. These lists were carefully verified and cross-checked to ensure complete
10 	and up-to-date information, as follows:
13 	Contractors: contracting companies are classified by Ministry of Public Work and Housing into
15 	six classes according to their capital, and their experience in completing projects with a 16 	minimum total value. As considerably meeting in JCCA, the classes which usually take the

18 	housing projects are classes D and E as summarized in Table 3 which comprise 243 companies
22 	Table 3. Classes of Contractors
25 	Architectural firms, consulting companies and engineering offices: they represent a number of
27 	1198 companies and offices (JEA, 2013). According to the JEA, architectural firms, consulting
29 companies and  engineering offices share  similar architectural  activities; thus they are   classified
30 under the same category. This point was taken into consideration when the population of the
32 study was selected, and for the purpose of the study, the researchers chose 85 companies and
33 offices of  which  their  capital  exceeds JOD  10000  (MIT,  2013; JEA,  2013).The  sampling was
3435  	confined to specific types of companies conforming to& the criteria  set by the researchers:
37 contracting companies where their capital between JOD 20000 and JOD 50000 (class D and E)
38 and architectural companies with capital in excess of JOD 10000.
41 	The researchers followed a census sampling approach "whereil the  sample size equals the
43 population size" .Therefore the sample size for contractors equals 243 while the sample size for
44 the architects is 85.The response rates were: 61.2 % and 22.6 % for architects and contractors
4546  	respectively. This study implemented a number of statistical techniques and procedures to
48 answer the questions of study. Descriptive statistics and reliability analysis were carried out to
49 estimate the internal consistency of items, where Cronbach’s coefficient, α, was selectedity for this
5051  	test. Then, t-test (one-tailed) at 95 % confidence level was conducted among the means of
53 responses from the two groups (contractors and architects) to check any significant differences
54 among the groups’ perceptions regarding the importance of various factors. All statistical
5556  	procedures were estimated using Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 15.0
58 (Gerber   and Finn,  2005). In order to increase the validity of the research findings, the
59 researchers also use cause-effect diagram (Fishbone) in the analysis procedure in order to
explore the theoretical links of the factors affection quality in the Jordanian housing sector. “The Fishbone Diagram” is easy to use and is an effective cause-and-effect technique. The diagram
refers to its use in identifying the causes of various quality characteristics, including problems
(Ozeki and Asaka, 1990). This type of analysis will illustrate the most important quality factors
67	and their variables in order to support the new proposed conceptual framework for this study.
Results and Discussion
15 The  responses  indicated  that  the  majority  of  contractors  who  participated  in  the  study  were
16 100% male and 49.1% with ages ranging between 41 and 50 years old. The contractors were

18 	well experienced professionals and were able to give reliable data. The respondents over five
20 years of experience in the construction industry were 89.9% and over 49.1% of them had over a
21 ten years’ experience. All of the respondents have graduated from high school  and  72.7%  of
23 	them hold bachelor degrees. Amongst the architectural companies, the large proportion is 65.4% Qualit
26 	about 55.8% were less than 40 years, 78.8% of them hold bachelor degrees, and 15.4% of the y 25 	of the respondents which were male and 34.6% were female. The statistical results  show that
28 	participants have completed graduated studies. About 11.5% of the respondents had less than 5
30 years’ experience, 21.2% between 6-10 years, 55.8% between 10-15 years, and 11.5% over 15

38 	of items covering the issues to be measured. The researchers utilized the available literature to
41 with five Jordanian academic people in order to ensure technical accuracy and clarity and to il
43 	improve the questionnaire. The internal consistency method was used to measure construct
45 reliability by the use of Cronbach’s alpha. In the present research, the coefficient of Cronbach’s
46 alpha for all factors was 0.82. This indicates a high level of reliability which is above the

The homogeneity of variance must be examined to know if the variances  assumed are  equal  or not at significance ‘p’ of 95% (α = 0.05), then t-test is conducted. For this purpose, the researchers examine these statistical hypotheses, if significance ‘p’ value is less than 0.05;

44 	4.3 The Highest Three Factors
46 47 	In this research, human resources management is the first highest factor from the view point of

48 	contractors and architects combined. However, there is no significant difference according to the
50 	mean of overall averages of the contractors and architects concerning this factor. Table 11 shows
52 that this factor (education and training, involvement, and teamwork) is considered as the most
53 important factor which affects quality in many countries.
56 	Table 11. Supportive Studies of Human Resources Management.
Research results have revealed that education and training are the most important elements affecting quality. This result is in agreement with the conclusion drawn by Chan et al.(2006),
Lam et al. (2008) and Lai and Cheng (2003) in Chinese companies where it was conducted for public housing. It is in agreement with pheng and Hong (2005) in Singaporean companies from
67	the view point of contractors. The result also is in agreement with the study of Sharmma and
9 	Gudanne (2002) in Australlian construction companies that stated that they had an on going
1112  l Gunaydin (1997) emphasized that training should be targeted to every level of the company and 10 quality training programmes as an important quality strategy. In the U.S.A, a study by Arditi and
14 in all stages of construction. Findings from an Egyptian survey in 1998 by Abed-Razek reflected
15 that the most important factor was up-grading for the current training methods.
17 	project team (contractor, subcontractor, supplier, designer, project manager,  and customer) must
19 	be involved in the quality process (Pheng and Teo, 1996). Severof 	al authors have suggested the
21 	importance of involvement in decision making which enhances the individuals’ self-esteem and
22 improves ability to solve problems (e.g. Metri, 2005; Fotopoulos and  Psomas,  2009). Each 24 project also requires an effective teamwork on jobsite where both the construction managers and 26 workers require a paradigm shift to team approach which will lead to a better support to all y 25
27 	members (Hellard, 1991; Haupt and Whiteman, 2004; Pheng and Hong, 2005).
30 	Customer Satisfaction is the second most important factor. It is not surprising that most 31 	respondents understood the importance of customer satisfaction and emphasized the satisfaction
33 	of customers in support of overall quality. Also, there is no significant difference in the mean of
35 	responses of contractors and architects regarding this factor (Table 12).&  34
37 	Table 12. Supportive Studies of Customer Satisfaction.
40 	As shown in Table 12, this study is in agreement with studies of U.K, U.S.A,  Singapore, il
42 	Malaysia, India, Australia, and China. In construction, quality consciously focuses all parties to
44 the common goal of systematically identifying and meeting the customers’ requirements as the
45 superordinate goal where customers’ requirements are increasingly complex and expectations
47 	uncertain. However, a large proportion of migrant labor may exacerbate these difficulties,  and
49 the application of quality can become difficult (Pheng and Wei, 1996). Customer satisfaction is ity 48
50 achieved by ensuring that drawings and specifications are communicated to the  rest  of  the
52 	parties, should there be any changes. The parties affected by the changes can then promptly
54 	adjust their information and help to reduce the amount of time wasted.
Construction specific factors were ranked as the fifth highest factor from the perspective of contractors and the fourth highest factor of architects, and the third highest factor on average.
This shows that most of the contractors and architects know the value of construction specific factors and use it to improve the level of quality. This really implies the awareness of specific
67	factors such as the construction industry officials, associations, and governments.
9 agreement with findings of (Arditi and Gunaydin, 1997; Abdel- Razek, 1998; Lau and Tang,
10 2009) as shown in Table 13.

16 	Companies that pursue construction specific factor will be able to reduce total quality cost and

28 importance of construction specific factors. In the case of this survey, it can be clearly shown
29 that there is a significant difference between architects and contractors, where architects give 30
31 	higher concern regarding this factor.

37 	The contractors, nevertheless, pay more attention to completing the works on schedule and
39 controlling the costs within budget than to achieving quality in construction. One reason for this
40 might be that the contractors cannot plan and control the  works; they lack the skills to  interpret il
42 	the design and cannot provide the end products on site in accordance with the design and
44 specifications. Another reason is that the designers do  not consider the  “build ability”  problems
45 in design. Designers are sometimes unaware of the difficulties contractors experience on site.
47 	Consequently, contractors do not realize that it is not the quality that costs but rather the non-
49 	conformance to quality that is expensive. 	ity
4.4 The Lowest Three Factors
The lowest three factors in ascending order are resources, continuous improvement, and strategic management. Resources are the least important factor affecting quality in the Jordanian housing

25 	Razek (1998), they showed little relative importance of the resources factor to improve
27 	construction quality and concluded that it is a well-known fact that resources are mainly a part of
29 	top management commitment and partially of other factors.
31 	The contractors and architects appeared to agree statistically on the relative importance and
33 ranking of the continuous improvement. These results are in agreement with the outcomes of the
34 research conducted in India by Metri  (2005) which &revealed  that a continuous improvement

41 	Hellard (1991) argued that use of statistical methods has relatively very little effect onil 	 the
43 quality of construction projects and that individual construction projects are unique and can
44 eliminate the potential for any kind of statistical process control. However, there is a clear 45

52 As shown in Table 15, statistical techniques and benchmarking are the least applied tools in
53 some countries,  but  widely used  in  specific countries   where  quality was  previously developedM
55 and considered as one of the most important factors, such as U.S.A (e.g. Arditi and Gunaydin,
The previous work emphasized that continuous improvement will yield excellence in design and create teamwork. This quality factor is still not applied in Jordan in an integrated way and a little

67	histograms, cause and effect diagrams, check sheets, Pareto diagrams, graphs, control charts, and
