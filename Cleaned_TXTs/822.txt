Artificial neural networks (ANN) exhibit excellent performance in complex problems and have been increasingly applied in the research field of construction management (CM) over the last few decades. However, few papers draw up a systematic review to evaluate the state-of-the-art research on ANN in CM. In this paper, content analysis is performed to comprehensively analyze 112 related bibliographic records retrieved from seven selected top journals published between 2000 and 2020. The results indicate that the applications of ANN of interest in CM research have been significantly increasing since 2015. Back-propagation was the most widely used algorithm in training ANN. Integrated ANN with fuzzy logic/genetic algorithm was the most commonly employed way of addressing the CM problem. In addition, 11 application fields and 31 research topics were identified, with the primary research interests focusing on cost, performance, and safety. Lastly, challenges and future directions for ANN in CM were put forward from four main areas of input data, modeling, application fields, and emerging technologies. This paper provides a comprehensive understanding of the application of ANN in CM research and useful reference for the future.

ANN is a mathematical model inspired by the biological brain to acquire the knowledge hidden in historical data for information-processing and computation purposes [9]. As a branch of artificial intelligence (AI) technology, ANN performs well in dealing with complex nonlinear problems without assuming the relationships between variables, because of the self-learning, self-organizing functions, and high-speed computing capabilities [10]. For these reasons, ANN is particularly suitable for solving practical CM problems, which is difficult for classical mathematics and traditional modeling [9]. ANN can play roles in the prediction, optimization, classification, and decision-making in the practice of CM and has been used in CM since the early 1990s [11]. For instance, Juszczyk et al. [12] proposed a predictive model for fast cost analyses and conceptual estimates in the planning stage. The crack detection method of wavelet neural network was proposed by Turkan et al. [13] to minimize the possibility of facility failure.
Since ANN is the most commonly used AI method in the architecture, engineering and construction industry [14], a growing body of literature reviewing ANN applications has been published. For instance, Sony et al. [15] systematically reviewed the application of convolutional neural networks in structural state assessment. These reviews on ANN focused on a specific application instead of targeting CM. Pan and Zhang [16] reviewed AI in CM in which ANN is mentioned limitedly in some paragraphs. Adeli [17] reviewed the application status of ANN from 1989 to 2000 in CM which was limited to research before 2000. It can be seen there is no thorough review and systematic analysis of the existing literature on ANN in CM for the past 20 years. The absence of an up-to-date systematic review on ANN in CM makes it difficult for researchers to understand the diversity and complexity of using ANN for CM.
Accordingly, it is necessary to conduct a comprehensive and structured review of
ANN in CM. The main objective of this review is to: (1) identify the publication trend and important publications over the past 20 years on ANN in CM; (2) provide key information related to the research status of ANN, such as ANN types; (3) uncover specific application fields, hot topics, research interests of ANN in CM; (4) clarify which project lifecycle stage has been focused on by previous studies and what perspectives have been researched; (5) identify current research progress and challenges as well as the promising research directions.
Artificial Neural Networks
The concept of ANN was first proposed in 1943. It is an information-processing technology that simulates the human brain and the nervous system. Similar to the human brain, ANN does not follow specific rules to process data but uses the data that it obtains to abstract the rules governing them [18].
ANN in simple terms is a biologically inspired computational model. Like the neuron, it is an interconnection of nodes as is shown in Figure 1a [19]. Each node receives multiple inputs from other nodes through connections with related weights. If the weighted sum of inputs exceeds the threshold value of the node, it activates and passes the signal through the transfer function and sends it to the next node. This process can be expressed as a mathematical model [20]:
where y is the output of the node, f is the transfer function, ωij is the weight of input x, and b is the threshold value.
The general architecture of an ANN is shown in Figure 1a [21]. The nodes in the network are organized into linear arrays called layers. Generally, three layers are included, the input layer with input neurons, hidden layer(s) with hidden neurons, and output layers with output neurons. Input layers are responsible for receiving signals from specific datasets. Hidden layers give a critical computational ability to the system, are predominant stages of ANN. Output layers make the final decisions and output results [22]. Designing the network topology involves determining the number of nodes at each layer, the number of layers in the network, and the path of the connections among the nodes [19].
The ANN uses a learning process to train the network, which can be summarized in Figure 1b. To ensure the reliability of the ANN in tackling the problem before putting it into operation, running a validation protocol is necessary [18]. Part of the sample is prepared for training the ANN (training set), while the remaining cases are used to assess the predictive capability of the ANN (testing set or validation set) [18]. The subsequent training process is explained below [19,20,23]. During training, the input layer broadcasts a pattern to all the hidden nodes. The system is then required to calculate the output value according to Equation (1) and broadcasts the result to the output nodes. Each output node then calculates a weighted sum, and an actual result is generated. In the next stage, the system has to decide whether further learning is required, which is accomplished by comparing the obtained total difference with a specified acceptable error given by the system developer. If the goal is not met, the output nodes calculate the derivatives of the error with respect to the weights and the result is sent back through the system to all the hidden nodes. Then, each hidden-layer node and output-layer node will change their weights to compensate for the corrections. Once the weights have been changed, the computation starts all over again. New output values are obtained, and the cycle continues until a desired result is obtained. Finally, the ANN system that passed the test can now be used to predict the outcome of an input not previously seen by the ANN.

The flexible network topology and the self-learning ability make ANN a powerful algorithm for learning [21]. Adaptivity allows ANN to perform well even when the environment or the system being modeled varies with time. However, some shortcomings of ANN are also revealed. The network structures and the ability to deal with problems of ANN are two manifestations of its characteristics, and the corresponding pros and cons of ANN are listed in Table 1 according to the literature [26].

Different methods are available for reviewing the literature. Content analysis is a powerful technique for systematically making valid inferences based on written, verbal, or visual communication messages so as to describe and quantify specific phenomena [29]. Its applicability in the CM literature review has been confirmed [30]. Qualitative content analysis focuses on data classification, while quantitative content analysis determines the frequency of classified data by counting the number of times a topic is mentioned [30]. It helps reveal the potential content of documents by objectively stating events that are not immediately apparent [29]. Content analysis was adopted in this paper because of its fit for the research purpose. A three-stage process was adopted based on the procedures developed by Hu et al. [31], including data collection, content analysis, and discussion (Figure 2).
Data Collection
Journal Selection
Research in CM combines multiple disciplines covering both technical and managerial topics [32]. Therefore, it is necessary to collect journals based on a comprehensive academic database [33]. Web of Science was chosen in this paper because of its comprehensiveness, organized structure and scientific robustness [34].
Articles in high-ranked journals represent the most influential research, so there is consensus within the profession regarding the preferability of picturing research within a field based on these articles [35]. In light of the purpose of sampling, journals that have an important impact and top quality in CM were selected. Journal selection is based on the 2019 Scopus journal metrics and the ranking of construction management journals [36,37]. In addition, these journals must have published at least three articles related to the topic between 2000 and 2020. Selected journals are as follows (Table 2).

According to the objective of this review, it is necessary to collect as much of the literature of ANN applications in CM as possible. To realize this target, keywords were selected following related previous review studies in CM [31,38]. As a result, the key search words “neural network” and “construction management/engineering management” were used. The keyword search in web of science was set as the “topic” in order to retrieve all the publications containing the selected keywords in their title, abstract, or selected keywords section. The search period was set to include the last 20 years, from January 2000 to December 2020. The “document type” was limited to “article”, because journal articles usually provide more comprehensive and higher-quality information than other types of publications [39] and most reviews of CM study only focus on journal articles [40]. As a result, four hundred potential documents were initially retrieved from the selected journals. Adopting a two-round strategy, the same process as in Reference [31], the contents of the articles were further examined through manual screening. The first round of selection checked the articles’ title, abstract and keywords information, followed by a second round of selection conducted by reading and analyzing the whole article to double-check articles. The following criteria were used [41]: ANN was studied as the main technology or played an important role rather than a comparison. Finally, 112 articles were selected and used in this study (Table 2).
Content Analysis
Qualitative and quantitative content analyses were combined in this paper. Firstly, according to the type of journal and year of publication, the selected articles were profiled to show the trend of research publications related to ANN in CM from the perspective of publication time and journal type. Secondly, after a manual review of the article’s methodology and even the entire article, the specific ANN types were classified, and their frequency was calculated through detailed information analysis extracted from the article. All types are counted when more than one type was used in the same article [42]. Thirdly, to identify the pattern of application of ANN in the articles, the studies were divided into three categories, namely hybrid model application, individual model application, and model comparison. Then, their frequencies were presented through the analysis of the article one by one. Fourthly, as a general description of the knowledge, skills, and tools required for project management published by the Project Management Institute (PMI), Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK) was used in this paper as the primary reference for the classification of research fields [43]. The main research fields and their specific hot topics were identified and recorded by sorting out the contents of the literature based on PMBOK. Finally, all studies were classified into four lifecycle stages, namely planning and design, bidding, construction, and maintenance and operation, and three levels, namely the project level, enterprise level, and industry level, to reveal the focus stage and perspective of current research.
Results of Content Analysis
Publication Trend of Research on ANN in CM from 2000 to 2020
To analyze the publication trend of ANN in CM in the past 20 years, the selected articles were profiled based on journal and publication year. The number of articles and their journal sources are summarized in Table 2. It can be found that JCEM (38) and AC (34) include the most publications on this topic, accounting for 64.29% of the total, while the remaining five journals account for 35.71%. Figure 3 shows the publication trend for ANN in CM from 2000 to 2020. It reveals an overall increase since 2000 within three years. Especially since 2015, the number of related documents has increased dramatically. This result is consistent with the application trend of data mining technology in the construction industry [44], as the construction industry has a growing need to process a large amount of heterogeneous data [45].
Types of ANN Applied in CM Research
Figure 4 provides the statistical result of the types of ANN used in the reviewed articles. The results show that a total of 13 types of ANN were employed in the CM research. BPNN has captured the most attention and accounts for 45.1% of the total. MLPNN and CNN both account for 13.8%. In addition, RBFNN, GRNN, and PNN have also received some attention.
BPNN is a multilayer feed-forward neural network trained according to the error back-propagation algorithm. It has the general advantages of all neural networks such as self-learning and adaptive capabilities, nonlinear mapping capabilities, and high fault tolerance [46], and its own advantages, such as simplicity and good generalization capability [47]. A detailed review found that BPNN as a representative of ANN in CM has been applied to all application fields, demonstrating its absolute domination.

MLPNN is typically designed with a fully connected feed-forward-based architecture and trained by static back-propagation, LM, Gauss-Newton, or other algorithms. Its input layer contains a set of sensory nodes, and both hidden layers and the output layer contain computing nodes [48]. It has been applied to complete a wide range of classification and prediction tasks in the CM field. The CNN model achieves feature extraction through a stack of layers (such as convolution, activation, and polarization) on the input image [49]. It is one of the deep learning algorithms that has been widely used in the image field [50].
The characteristics and main research fields of BPNN, MLPNN, and CNN are listed in Table 3.

Methods Integrated with ANN Applied in CM Research
The result shows that 61% of studies established a hybrid model in which ANN is integrated with other methods to solve the problems in CM, and the number is considerably greater than that of the individual model. Researchers are adopting more and more hybrid models to improve the performance and overcome the defects of a particular method [55,56].
Figure 5 illustrates the distribution of methods/algorithms integrated with ANN more than twice in the reviewed studies. The results indicate that Fuzzy Logic (FL) (21) is used more often combined with ANN in the selected literature than the others, followed by Genetic Algorithms (GA) (15). Furthermore, case-based reasoning and long short-term memory have achieved ideal results in auxiliary ANN applications.

Most research on the application of individual ANN models has focused on using its capabilities to deal with highly nonlinear problems. However, the accuracy of the estimation results is not very high when dealing with uncertainty and subjectivity issues. These disadvantages can be partially overcome by integrating FL, which is a tool for representing uncertain and imprecise information [57]. FL imitates the human decision-making process in a high-level way for automated systems to describe highly complex, undefined, or difficult-to-analyze topics [58]. However, FL encounters difficulties in determining parameters. ANN was introduced to resolve this problem and to infuse into the FL a capacity for self-learning. As the actual CM problems are always complex and uncertain due to the changing nature of the construction industry [59], FNN has been widely used in CM.
GA is a stochastic search approach inspired by the natural evolution process, which involves crossover, mutation, and survival fitness evaluation. It is widely used to identify parameter values for ANN models to solve search and optimization problems. GA helps improve the convergence speed, and its mutation mechanism avoids confinement to locally optimal solutions [60]. In addition, the complementary combination of ANN, GA, and FL can maximize their respective merits [61]. When dealing with CM problems with complex, uncertain, and subjective characteristics such as dynamic project success prediction and subcontractor performance evaluation, FL is used to deal with uncertainty and approximate inference, while ANN is employed in fuzzy input-output mapping and GA is used for optimization.
Application Fields and Hot Topics on ANN in CM
Twelve application fields are identified, as shown in Table 4. Cost is the most common application field of ANN (23.21%), followed by performance (16.07%) and safety (11.60%).
Cost is the main criterion for project feasibility study and early project decisionmaking. Cost overruns can lead to project cancellations [62]. The highest degree of attention (23.21%) demonstrates that ANN has made progress in solving traditional cost management problems. Performance is critical to construction [63]. A total of 16.07% of studies focused on performance measurement and improvement, which is the second hottest topic after cost. According to Ayhan and Tokdemir [64], more than 1.3 million people suffer from occupational accidents in the construction industry annually. Although safety management systems have been introduced in recent decades, occupational safety is still poor [65]. Table 4 (11.60%) indicates that safety is a major concern in the construction
With the application of information and sensor technology, the availability of an extensive training dataset makes ANN a promising approach in construction safety management [65]. In addition to the above three fields, quality and resources also received significant attention, and both accounted for 8.04%. All application fields and specific topics are shown in Table 4.
Upon further analysis, 31 specific topics about ANN in CM can be extracted from the above 11 fields. Table 4 shows all ANN topics in CM in the selected articles and the percentage of articles on each topic. It implies that cost estimation is the most widely discussed topic (11.61%), followed by project performance evaluation (9.82%) and worker safety behavior assessment (8.93%).
For construction cost estimation, ANN is a representative method for early construction cost estimation by identifying cost influencing factors and establishing a prediction model based on historical data [47]. Juszczyk, Zima, and Lelek [12] presented an original approach of building construction cost predictive models based on ensembles of some MLPNNs. Rafiei and Adeli [66] used advanced machine learning concepts to create innovative construction cost estimation models, including an unsupervised deep Boltzmann machine learning approach and a soft-max layer three-layer BPNN. Some studies compared multiple models to find the best one, for example, comparing ANN with multiple regression analysis [67] and comparing different types of ANN [68]. ANN is recognized as one of the most common AI techniques for parametric cost modeling, so determining model parameters is the key stage of model development [69]. The selected literature has been surveyed to identify the drivers in the cost field, and Table 5 presents important variables in main topics.
