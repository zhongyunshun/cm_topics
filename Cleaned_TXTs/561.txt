Using the four input± output tables compiled in Turkey to date, the aim of this paper is to examine the construction sector’s role in the Turkish economy and analyse its relationships with the other sectors of the national economy. Analysis results show that the share of construction in Gross National Product (GNP) and National Income (NI) tend to increase whereas the GNP share of manufacturing is relatively stable and that of services tend to increase after an abrupt decrease in 1985; backward linkage indicators and output multipliers, as well as forward linkage indicators and input multipliers of construction industry are stable; and ® nally, direct and total construction inputs from manufacturing show relative stability and those from services tend to increase in recent years. These ® ndings point out the similarities between the Turkish construction industry and some advanced industrial countries (AICs) like Japan and Italy showing signs of growing `maturity’ of the Turkish economy.
Input± output analysis, backward and forward linkage indicators, output and input multipliers, Turkish construction sector
Introduction
This paper brie¯ y analyses the economic role of the construction sector in the Turkish economy using the four input± output (IO) tables compiled to date. As an economy develops, the construction sector changes its economic role. In this process, the construction sector gradually turns away from manufacturing, its main partner in the earlier phases of economic development, toward services. For a more detailed discussion of this process, see for example Bon (1991, 1992), Bon and Pietroforte (1990, 1993). These studies show many similarities between the US, UK, Italy and Japan. Particularly, the results of the Turkish input± output analysis show similarities with the Japanese case, so this paper follows the main structure of the paper by Bon and Yashiro (1996).
To the best of our knowledge, there are no published input± output studies of the Turkish construction sector itself, let alone studies that encompass all four tables published to date. However, Bocutoglu (1990) uses input-output data in his investigation of industrial economics, but he treats construction as a part of the service sector. Construction sector as such is not analysed in that study.
We will ® rst brie¯ y discuss the place of IO analysis in the study of construction sector’s role in the overall economic activity using the construction sector’s input and output pro® les (for further details see Bon, 1988, 1991). We will then introduce the Turkish IO tables. We will proceed by presenting the key ® ndings of the research, and ® nally offer our conclusions.

Input± output analysis is based on the idea that commodities are needed in the current production of
other commodities. National income accounts provide the necessary data for IO analysis. An IO table shows the intersectoral ¯ ows in monetary terms for a particular year where the ¯ ows represent intermediate goods and services. In addition to the interindustrial ¯ ows, there appears a ® nal demand column showing where the ® nal products go and a value-added row showing where the primary inputs come from. The construction sector is typically represented by one row and column. The construction row shows where the construction sector’s output goes, while the construction column shows where the construction inputs come from. The construction sector’s input and output pro® les offer a sui generis representation of construction technology (for details, see Bon, 1991).
Turkish input± output tables
In this paper we use four Turkish input± output tables compiled between 1973 and 1990, which are presented in Appendix 1. Furthermore, the aggregation scheme that is used for the analysis is presented in Appendix 2. The food processing sector, which is a comparatively important industry in a newly industrialized country (NIC) like Turkey, is treated separately from the manufacturing sector. It should be noted that the aggregation scheme used here is far from arbitrary and represents the basic structure of the economy. Further disaggregation of sectors is possible; however, it is not attempted for reasons of space.
Although the constructed IO tables are based on the of® cially published IO tables that are compiled by State Institute of Statistics of the Turkish Government, some further adjustments have been made in order to make Turkish IO tables compatible with those of other countries. The major problem was the missing values of construction maintenance and repair (M&R) services that constitute the interindustry outputs of Turkish construction sector. These data, originally collected under ® nal demand values for building services, are separated and entered into the tables as construction output ¯ ows to other industries. However, due to the lack of data, maintenance and repair values are highly conservative as they do not include the output of other construction services like infrastructure facilities and repair services carried out by unregistered companies which are known to dominate the maintenance and repair sector in Turkey.
The results of analysis are presented in Table 1 which shows the twelve data series obtained from the four Turkish IO tables compiled between 1973 and 1990. Key ® ndings will be highlighted by using six ® gures with data in pairs.

Figure 1 shows the trend of shares of construction in GNP and NI from 1973 to 1990. It goes without saying that IO tables are not necessary for the calculation of these shares; nevertheless, they provide more accurate data than standard accounts because of the doubleentry accounting rules under which they are compiled. The shares of construction in GNP and NI can be used as indicators of the changing role of the construction
sector at various stages of economic growth and development. It has been argued that construction activity follows the bell-shaped pattern of development of the manufacturing sector, its primary supplier and the old engine of economic growth (Bon, 1992). The analysis of the Turkish IO tables shows that shares of construction in GNP and NI tend to increase. The increasing trend of the construction sector’s share in GNP is an expected ® nding as Turkey can be placed at the transition point between a less developed country (LDC) and a newly industrialized country (NIC). In the recent period, the GNP share of construction is about 12% and NI share is approximately 5%. The share of construction in NI is about one half of GNP share, which has to do with the fact that construction is an assembly industry in which the production of materials and components takes place mainly in manufacturing, that is, off the construction site.
For comparison with the construction sector, the GNP shares of manufacturing and services are shown in Figure 2. The GNP share of the manufacturing industry decreases between 1973 and 1979, increases between 1979 and 1985, and decreases again after 1985. However, the increasing and decreasing trends which are just in opposite directions with the trend of construction are so slight that the GNP share of manufacturing industry is relatively stable around 25% and it has still the highest share in GNP. Similar to the construction sector, the share of services in GNP tend to increase after an abrupt decrease in 1985. The slight decreasing trend of GNP share of manufacturing and increasing trend of GNP share of services in recent years point out that these sectors may be changing places as old and new engines of economic development. However, it is clear that data associated with more recent years should be analysed in order to be able to talk about `the change of guards’ in the Turkish economy.

The `pull effect’ of the construction industry is analysed in Figure 3. The backward linkage indicators measure the proportion of a sector’s direct inputs that come from other sectors of the national economy, rather than primary inputs. The output multipliers, also called total backward linkage indicators, measure the total effect of a monetary unit change in ® nal demand for the goods and services of the construction sector on the output of all sectors. The backward linkage indicators and output multipliers are both showing stable trends suggesting Turkey’s NIC status. The construction industry has one of the highest backward linkage indicators among all sectors giving a rough indication that the economic pull of the construction sector is very strong in Turkey. This is to be expected, as it assembles the products of all other sectors. As the backward linkage indicator is above 0.50, it shows that the majority of materials and components are manufactured off-site.

Figure 4 presents the forward linkage indicators and input multipliers that measure the `push effect’ of Figure 4	Construction forward linkages and input
construction sector on the Turkish economy. The forward linkage indicator shows the proportion of a sector’s direct output that goes to other sectors of the national economy rather than to ® nal consumption. The input multiplier measures the effect of a monetary unit change in primary input available to a sector on the input of all industries. The strength of the M&R construction subsector can be analysed by measuring the forward linkage indicators and input multipliers (for greater detail see Bon, 1991, and Bon and Pietroforte, 1993). The analysis shows that the main consumer of M&R services in Turkey is the service sector followed by transportation and trade services. Figure 4 shows that the percentage of direct construction output going to other industries is around 2% (the lowest value among all sectors) and it decreases to as low as 1% in 1990. The input multiplier of the Turkish construction industry is stable at around 1.0, pointing out the weakness of the M&R sector. This result may stem in part from the fact that the data associated with M&R activities are not reliable as explained above.
Figure 5 presents direct and total construction inputs coming from manufacturing. The direct inputs, also known as technical coef® cients, show the proportion of direct inputs of construction coming from manufacturing. The total manufacturing inputs represent the change in manufacturing outputs resulting from a monetary unit change in ® nal demand for goods and services of the construction sector. Results show that both the direct and total inputs from manufacturing remain stable. Still, around 0.38 TL (Turkish Lira) per 1 TL of the construction input comes from manufacturing while the total effect of a 1 TL change in construction sector’s ® nal demand can be as high as 0.60 TL.
The direct and total construction inputs from services, both of which are growing in recent years, are shown in Figure 6. Around 0.02 TL per 1 TL of construction inputs comes from services.
Figure 5	Direct and total construction inputs from manufacturing
effect is around 0.06 TL per 1 TL change in construction sector’s ® nal demand. Although the inputs from services increase, it is not possible to conclude that the manufacturing and service sectors are changing places as main suppliers of the construction industry because the direct inputs coming from manufacturing are still approximately ten times bigger than the direct inputs from the services. The results show the growing importance of services as a supplier for the construction industry, however it is clear that service sector is far from replacing the manufacturing industry.
Finally, the instability of direct construction input patterns during different periods should be noted. Although, direct input shares are relatively stable for the manufacturing industry, which is the main supplier of construction industry in Turkey, it is examined that construction input patterns are changing in different sectors. In recent years (1985± 90), construction input shares of all sectors except trade and services tend to decrease which can be explained by changes in the construction technology.

The analysis presented here con® rms that general trends in construction technology discussed by Bon (1991, 1992) hold true for a NIC like Turkey and the analysis shows similarities with Japanese and Italian construction sectors.
The increasing GNP and NI shares of construction demonstrate that, as far as the inverted U-shaped relationship between GNP share of construction and GNP per capita is concerned (see Bon, 1992), Turkey can be placed at the transition point between LDC and NIC during the analysis period. It should also be noted that the most recent data is for year 1990 and it has been nine years after that date. More recent data should be incorporated into the analysis in order to be able to draw more reliable conclusions.
One of the major ® ndings of the study is that, like in AICs, the GNP share of the service sector is growing whereas that of the manufacturing sector remains stable in recent years. Similarly, construction inputs from the services sector tend to increase, however, it should be noted that services is far from dominating the construction inputs and the manufacturing industry is still the main supplier of construction industry.
The analysis points at the stable trend of construction backward linkage indicators and output multipliers, as well as forward linkage indicators and input multipliers during the recent years. The lower ® gures for forward linkage indicators and input multipliers demonstrate the weakness of M&R sector in Turkey. This may be partly due to the fact that reliable data associated with these activities are lacking in Turkey. However, it is clear that the economic pull of the construction industry is one of the highest among all sectors and the government, being the main purchaser of construction output in Turkey, can use the construction industry as an instrument to increase the overall economic output.
It should be ® nally noted that NICs and LDCs are likely to play an increasingly important role in the international trade of material-intensive and labour-intensive construction materials and components. Although the poor quality or lack of economic data concerning those countries makes it harder to carry out input± output analysis, the available data should be analysed as thoroughly as possible. In this way, it may be possible to make a comparative analysis of construction technology between various countries that can offer useful policy guidelines.
