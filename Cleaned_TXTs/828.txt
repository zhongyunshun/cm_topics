Construction management is considered a very important field in civil engineering. A lot of tracks had in civil engineering that achieve construction management, such as risk, time, material and labour. One of the best tracks that achieve construction is risk management in modern civil applications. Moreover, this vital track is connected directly with labour life for this it is a very important issue. Hence, the main cause of death and injuries of labour during working is decline safety measures and sometimes building control management has been utilising traditional risk monitoring. It is considered a major concern of civil engineers. In this paper, a new labour safety system in construction management is proposed to provide a safe environment. However, risk management is designed that based on the fall detection approach of labour during working or walking at high-rise buildings. In other words, online monitoring risk is proposed to support and enhance construction management in civil engineering. The proposed system will play an important role by notifying the console panel on time that helps to reduce the death rate. However, the detection system is heavily based on real pictures received from the cameras. These cameras will be distributed randomly in the building area. These pictures will be analysed at the control panel in construction management for civil engineering. In other words, the decision-maker is strongly dependent on received pictures from these cameras. According to the experimental results, outstanding results is achieved from risk monitoring in construction management.

Methodology of the proposed system
In this paper, a risk detection system is proposed to help/ support civil engineers to protect labors from any potential risk. In addition, the steps below show the lifecycle of the proposed system.
Risk tracking is considered a very important field in construction management for modern applications in our daily life. In this paper, a new tracking system of risk is proposed that is heavily based on intelligent detection techniques. In other words, intelligent fall detection is designed for civil engineering to safe / recuse labour for any expected risk. The steps below show the major processing of the proposed system. However, Figure 2 is a block diagram of the proposed system. It starts from collect data from cameras installed at labour area work to detection/ notification alarms that are equipped in the control panel at engineering.
Block diagram of the proposed system
In the real world, various cameras are distributed in different areas. Many cameras are associated with area size. Figure 3 shows a number of cameras in the area.
Shows a number of cameras in the area
In this paper, a dataset is utilised to evaluate system performance. This data is generated from various cameras that are distributed in a different number of areas [17]. These behaviours will reflect all labors activities during the works. This dataset contains 70 (30 falls + 40 exercises of day by day living) arrangements. Fall occasions are recorded with 2 Microsoft Kinect cameras and relating accelerometric information. ADL occasions are recorded with just a single gadget (camera 0) and accelerometer. Sensor information was gathered utilizing PS Move (60Hz) and x-IMU (256Hz) gadgets [17]. The dataset is coordinated as follows. Each line contains a grouping of profundity and RGB images for camera 0 and camera 1 (corresponding to the floor and roof-mounted, individually), synchronization information, and crude accelerometer information. Extricated features from profundity maps are put away in CSV design. Each line contains one example of information relating to one profundity image.
The extracted features [17]
According to Figure 3, the sections from left to right are coordinated as follows:
• sequence name - camera name is precluded, because the entirety of the examples is from the front camera ('fall-01-cam0-d' is 'fall-01', 'adl-01-cam0-d' is 'adl-01, etc).
• label - depicts human stance in the profundity outline; '- 1' signifies individual is not lying, '1' signifies individual is lying on the ground; '0' is brief posture when an individual "is falling", we don't utilize '0' outlines in a grouping.
• HeightWidthRatio - bouncing box stature to width proportion.
• MajorMinorRatio - major to minor pivot proportion, registered from BLOB of the portioned individual.
• BoundingBoxOccupancy - the proportion of how a jumping box is involved by an individual's pixels.
• MaxStdXZ - standard deviation of pixels from the centroid for the abscissa (X hub) and the profundity (Z pivot), individually (it is processed on sectioned individual changed to the 3D point cloud).
• HHmaxRatio - human tallness in edge to human stature while standing proportion.
• H - real tallness (in mm).
• D - a distance of individual focus to the floor (in mm).
• P40 - the proportion of the quantity of the point mists having a place with the cuboid of 40 cm tallness and put on the floor to the quantity of the point mists having a place with the cuboid of stature equivalent to individual's stature.
Training and testing phase
In this phase, the proposed system will train and test with the k-nearest neighbour's algorithm. However, lightweight detection of this algorithm is the main point to utilised it. Moreover, it is trained with 60% of the dataset extracted from real scenarios [17]. In the next phase, the system is tested with 40% of the dataset that reflects real behaviours of labour. The results were obtained using the methods described in this work that is explained in the next subsection.
This section outlines the results of the study. However, the proposed system is tested with a various dataset that collected from different work labours areas. Some performance metrics are utilised in this work to measures the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed system which are accuracy, precision and time. The measuring process of each metric is explained in Equations below [18]:
Accuracy = correctly no. of class/ total no. of class ………………. (1)
Precision = (TP)/(TP+FP)………………………………………….(2) where,
TP =   Total number of normal behaviours for labours classified as normal.
FP = Total number of normal behaviours of labours classified as fall detection.

According to the tables above, we can easily notice that the proposed system could help civil engineers. In other words, the proposed system plays a vital role in safe life labours from any potential risk from work. Moreover, this system will help and support all construction management fields to provide an early alarm for any risk/ dangers. However, the Knn alarm will detect and identify any fall for labours.

In this paper, we are working on development construction management at civil engineering by risk tracking. In other words, a new risk tracking is a design that is based on fall detection of labour during work. this innovation can be proven to reduce the death rate and injury. However, this system can notify the console panel at a suitable time for recusing labour without any delay. Moreover, this system is not only fit for construction management in an industrial area but can be worn by disabling people or patients’ beds in a hospital. However, this system will support construction management by risk tracking. In future works, the proposed system will be based on camera and sensors, such as accelerometer, gyroscope, magnetometer and ultrasounds sensors. In addition, this system can train and test with other AI tools.
