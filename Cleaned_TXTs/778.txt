Education, Construction Management
Date of Submission: 14-06-2023                                                                           Date of acceptance:
I. 	Introduction
The construction management team's level of experience is a significant factor in determining how successful any given building project will be (Ayat et al., 2021). There is a significant demand for professionals who possess the appropriate combination of abilities in addition to the necessary amount of experience in order to properly handle complex building operations (Zheng et al., 2020). It has been accepted for some time that education plays a significant role in the development of a construction manager's capabilities (Al-Hashimy, 2022d; Al-Hashimy, Alabdullah, et al., 2022; Al-Hashimy, Said, et al., 2022; Al-HASHIMY & Al-hashimy, 2019). This study's primary objective is to investigate the ways in which learning influences performance and results in the field of construction management. Research conducted in the past has demonstrated the significance of providing construction managers with formal education. According to a number of studies, individuals with higher levels of education have a greater capacity to plan projects, maintain low prices, guarantee high quality, and reduce risks (Nuwan et al., 2021). According to the findings of this research, construction management degrees, certifications, and continuing education courses are valuable ways for professionals to build the foundation they need to advance in their careers (AL-HASHIMY, 2017; ALHASHIMY, 2018, 2019, 2022a, 2022b, 2022c).
In spite of the large body of knowledge that already exists, there are still holes in our empirical, methodological, theoretical, and conceptual understanding that need to be addressed. It's possible that there is a dearth of empirical evidence showing how specific teaching techniques and interventions genuinely improve construction management practices (Zikargae et al., 2022). The development of more rigorous research methods could be beneficial to the field of study that investigates the impact of education on the results achieved by construction management (Jääskä & Aaltonen, 2022). More research on the theoretical level is required in order for us to have a deeper understanding of the processes and conceptual frameworks that are responsible for the correlation between education and the management of building projects (AL-Hashmy et al., 2022; Arumugam et al., 2015; Hasan et al., 2015; HUSSAIN, 2017; Hussain, Alabdullah, Ahmed, et al., 2023; Hussain, Alabdullah, & Kanaan Abdulkarim, 2023; Hussein et al., 2015; Hussein et al., 2023). There is a possibility that the definition of education might be conceptually expanded to include learning throughout one's entire life as well as ongoing professional development, in addition to regular degree programs.
II. 	Questions Regarding the Investigation
What kind of impact does education have on the planning and carrying out of construction management projects?
How does one's level of education influence their capacity to maintain low prices in the field of construction management?
What kind of impact does training have on the processes that are used for quality control in building management?
What kinds of improvements may be made to risk management and risk reduction in construction
projects via the use of education and training?
The overarching purpose of this research is to evaluate the ways in which educational interventions can improve performance because firm performance is very important matter in all institutions as said by prior studies ( Alabdullah et al., 2013, 2014, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020, 2012; Alabdullah,, 2019; alabdullah, 2017; Ahmed et al., 2015; 20120) and results in the industry of construction management. By shining light on the connection between education and many aspects of construction management, the purpose of this study is to improve the overall success of the construction industry as well as the delivery of individual projects.
In a number of earlier investigations, the researchers found that education led to improvements in construction management. According to the findings of research conducted by Kukah et al. (2022), construction managers who have completed more schooling have a tendency to possess higher project planning and coordination skills, which ultimately results in better project outcomes. In a similar Cheng and Kong (2022) discovered that higher levels of education were positively correlated with more effective means of regulating construction prices. The detailed review conducted by Ogunbayo et al. (2022) highlighted the significance of training in ensuring the continued high quality of building projects. When construction managers held relevant credentials and participated in ongoing professional development, they demonstrated a higher level of attention to ensuring that quality was maintained across the board (Bliss, 2022). Many studies put in their account to test these variables taking in the consideration firm performance due to its high impact on the economy of the countries ((Alfadhel et al., 2015; Alabdulah, 2019; Kanaan et al., 2022; Alabdullah., 2022; Almashhadani and Almashhadani, 2021; Kanan et al., 2013) others also mentioned about the importance of education on construction management in its influenced by several control and determined factors (Alabdullah et al., 2023;
According to the findings of the research, there is a correlation between having a formal education and successfully managing projects in the construction business. There are gaps in the existing body of research that need to be addressed with new evidence, methodologies, theoretical frameworks, and conceptual understandings. This research was carried out with the intention of addressing these knowledge gaps and providing academic institutions and industry leaders with actionable recommendations regarding ways in which education might better influence management practices in the construction industry.
V. 	Conclusion
In conclusion to the review above, this study's findings shed light on the significant effect that education has on the administration of building projects. Previous research has repeatedly demonstrated that individuals with higher levels of education have more proficiency in project planning, cost control, quality assurance, and risk management. This study's findings lend further credence to these findings. The studies have shown a number of theoretical and practical weak spots that could benefit from further development. The construction sector desperately needs more research that examines the precise educational tactics and interventions that have a positive effect on management practices. The advancement of more robust research methods will also help shed light on the connection between classroom exposure and project outcomes in construction management.
Theoretical investigation into the underlying mechanisms and conceptual frameworks connecting education and construction management can enhance our understanding of the topic. A construction manager's career and the success of their projects both benefit from a broader understanding of education that incorporates lifelong, non-formal learning as well as ongoing professional growth. The research questions posed at the outset guided the investigation of how education influences construction management practices. By examining the connection between educational credentials and many facets of construction management, this study has led to a greater understanding of the part that education plays in ensuring good project delivery and overall industry performance. As a result, people have a clearer picture of education's benefits. The implications of this study go beyond the realm of academia and into the realm of the construction industry at large. Educational institutions should stress the importance of construction management education and provide courses that cover all aspects of the field. In addition, construction industry stakeholders including businesses and trade associations should promote and encourage construction managers to pursue ongoing education and training. The results of this study highlight the significance of formal education for those working in construction management. It stresses the value of formal training in enhancing project results and the need for ongoing education in this dynamic field. Investing in education and fostering a culture of lifelong learning can help the construction sector raise its standards and guarantee the effective management of building projects.
