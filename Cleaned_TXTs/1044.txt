Eyen though an estimated 80 0 Qfall building projects are procured by someform ofthe traditional building process. the project to project variations in performance are still subjectively and individually explained. The present paper addresses this particular domain. Using interorganizationai conflict among the project's task-organizations as a yardstick, the impact of a number (21 conflict-inducing organizational variables upon project cost, time and quality is measured and significant determinants ofperformance at these three levels are identified.
Building procurement, building process, project performance, regression analysis.
Introduction
As the main product of the building industry is normally purchased before it is designed or built, the usual methods of evaluating and selecting 'off the shelf' products cannot be applied. Instead, the building client is expected to initiatc and organize a project procurement process that will ultimately deliver the desired building. To do this successfully, however, the building client has to deal with an industry that is frequently described as a 'multi-industry', referring to its characteristic that for each project a large number of independent specialist organizations — ranging from professionals to businesses — have to be brought together within the framework of a temporary project organization.
The process of assembling the project organization is akin to that of organizational design in other industrial situations. Here, as elsewhere, the central problem remains the same: how to set up an organizational and management system that will allow for the highest overall project performance to be achieved? However, to attain this, the building client needs answers to questions such as: 'does this form of organization allow the basic operations of the process to be realized more effectively than any other? ' or 'which aspects of the organization are critical for achieving the desired end product? ' Or again 'what level of performance may be expected from a particular organizational or managerial intervention?
As yet, very little concrete information is available to a building client that could be of assistance in designing the project organization. Traditionally the building industry has opted for a generic approach to organizational design. That is, a limited number of generic prototype organizational arrangements are identified, their advantages and disadvantages based upon prior experience are listed, and the prospective building clients are encouraged to .match their requirernents and constraints with these models as closely as possible (Haviland,
Al A, 1981; NEDO, 1985). However, a serious difficulty with this approach has been

Characteristics Q/' the traditional building process
The organization of the traditional building process is greatly affected by the competitive tendering system and the sequential arrangement of work. Under the competitive tendering system, contractors are invited to bid for the project on the basis of documents such as scalc drawings, bills of quantities, general and particular specifications. and so on. Generally the contractor who can undertake to execute the work for the lowcst price is selected.
The seq uential arrangement of works. on the other hand, leads to the general build-up of thc projcct organization. From the time the building client makes the initial contact with the architect/engineer to the completion of the project, a large number of task-organizations become temporarily, though not simultaneously, part or the project organization, contributing to the materialization of the project. The temporary multi-organization thus created, however, is continuously confronted with disparities between two levels of organizational objectives: The temporary objectives of the project and the organization that is set up to build it; The permanent objectives of the participating task organizations.
"I'he first level of objectives in building projects is generally defined by the client system (i.e. the client in his/hcr socio-economic context). Various requirements and constraints are imposed upon the project jointly by the client and the cnvironment within which he/she operates and within which he she must build; the project organization is obligated to meet them. The second level of objectives includes those which are typical of all permanent organizations, namely, their survival in the market place, enhancement of their domains and their position in it, and so on. '[he architectural firms, the consulting engineers, the general and specialty contractors arc all permanent organizations in their own right and as such have their own perrnancnt organizational objectives.
Independent organizations, however, enter voluntarily into multi-organizational arrangements only under circumstances which they perceive as conducivc to the enhancement of their organizational objectives. Accordingly, each interacting task organization has an issueoutcome interest on any given issue, that is to say, an interest in seeing that the issue is resolved in such a way that the outcome is Inost advantageous to its own organizational objectives. Where the issue-outcome interests converge, the interaction is likely to cooperatively ensure attainment of the mutually desired issue-outcome. On the othcr hand, where issue-outcome interests of the interacting task organizations diverge, their interaction generates contest processes to attain desired but mutually exclusive issue-outcomes (Tuite et al., 1972).
The impact of the contest, however, must be put in perspective. In situations where single and independent organizations are competing for desired but exclusive issue-outcomes, such as in design competitions, the contest processes may actually be beneficial to the final outcome. On the other hand, on building projects where task-organizations have to work interdependently, the contest processes stemming from the diverging issue-outcome interests frequently lead to interorganizational conflicts and as a result have an adverse effect upon task performance.
From this point of view, for a project organization to function successfully it is necessary for each task-organization to be able to justify its issue-outcomes from its own independent

then, the domain consensus category can be represented by two factors: The clarity of the scope of participation, and b. The degree of specialization.
Regarding the conflict arising from these two factors, it can be proposed that [X 1] The greater the clarity of the scope of participation, the less the interorganizational conflict will be, and hence the higher the project team's performance, and [X2] The greater the degree of specialization of task-organizations, the less the deg.ree of interorganiz,ational conflict between them will be, and consequently, the higher the team's performance.
'üilahility and access to it! formation.• It has been noted that in multi-organizational situations any obstaclc to intcrorganizational communications are conducive to conflicts because decision making which involves several indcpendent organizations presumes an exchange of information and when this exchange is unsuccessful, co-operation between them can break down (Tuite et al., 1971 ). Obstacles to exchange of information can be either because of unsuccessful transmission of information, or due to systematic blocking of information by one party in order to prejudice the other party in the achievement of its goals.
Unsuccessful exchange of information is generally caused by systematic misunderstandings, insufficiency of information or noise. Thc inter-organizational conflicts arising due to the unsuccessful cxchange of information, however, should be regarded as pseudo conflicts because these situations in themselves need not give rise to any conflict if the parties manage to exchange information more effciently.
Blocking of infornvation. on the other hand, can give rise to very dysfunctional conflicts. Since inforrrration is a vital resource, especially in interdependent and sequcntial perfornmncc of tasks as on building projects, where one organization's task performance may entirely depend upon the information about the preceding task, its availability can have a determining effect upon the performance of thc participants in the project. The blocking may be intentional or unintentional. For example, manufacturers of windows may withhold test data about the deterioration of the air tightness of their windows over several years of service; this is an intentional denial of information which can lead to expensive retrofit bills and result in conflict. On the other hand, a delay in relaying information by an architect may be quite unintentional but can also have detrimental effect upon the performance of other participants, also resulting in conflict.
Thus, information can be scen as a source of interorganizational conflict leading to negative effects upon the project's performance when it is unsuccessfully exchanged, unavailable or its procurement takes excessive time. It may therefore be proposed that [X3] The greater the sufficiency of information. the less the chance of interorganization conflict will be. and hence the higher the level of the team's performance, and [X4] The greater the time needed to acquire the necessary information, the greater the chance of conflict will be, and hence the lower the level of the team's performance.
Interdependence of tasks: This refers to the extent to which two independent organizations depend upon each other for assistance, information, compliance or other coordinative acts in the performance o! their respective tasks. Interdependence can be symmetrical or asymmetrical (i.e. both or only one of the two concerned organizations has an incentive to co-ordinate), and it can range from high to low. It has been associated with high probability of conflict and is also seen as the root cause of lower project performance and even organizational breakdowns in the building industry (Crichton, 1967).
If the task performance of a unit depends on the task performance of other units and is accepted as such, then it is expected that the system is most likely to perform without any external controls. However, studies indicate that task interdependence, while it provides an

Four building projects in the Toronto Metropolitan Area werc selected on the basis of being procured by the traditional building process, covering a wide spectrum of types, sizes and the level of technical complexity (Residcntial condominium, $22 million: Concert Hall, $39 million; Retail/Off1ce complex $61 million; Hospital Expansion, $35 million), to provide data to test the above propositions. Within these, 21 task-organizations consisting of four categories architects, consulting engineers. general and subcontractors, were asked to evaluate:

The following model (Fig. 1 ) was used to measure interorganizational conflict and its impact upon the attainment of performancc objectives.
The data thus collected is analyscd in two steps. First, the multiple regression technique is used to regress the indepcndent variables, Xl to X6, upon each of the dependent variables cost, time and quality. In principle, the multiple regression equation is constructed to assess the simultaneous effect of several independent variables upon the dependent variable. Usually, in the general multiple regression equation, the dependent variable is seco as a linear function of Inore than one independent variable. Such a general form is expressed as:
where Y represents the dependent variable and the Xs the independent variables. bl to lh, designated as the partial regression coefficients, are the slopes of the regression linc for each independent variable, controlling for the eflécts of the other. Thus, bl , reflects the amount of changc in Y associated with a given change in xI . holding all other variables constant. ao designates the intercept point on the Y axis for all variables, and E designates the error component. Thc interpretation of the intercept, ao , is fairly straightforward. It is the average value of Y when each independent variable equals zero. Thus, the value of the dependent variable will be equal to ao when the independent variables xI to Xk register zero. The interpretation of the slope, bk the average change in Y associatcd with a unit change in Xk, when the other variables are held constant, requires more attention. By this means of control, .it is possible to separate out the eflC'Ct of Xk itself and free it of any distorting influences by the Mohsiiii

This brings us to the second step of the analysis, where, the three regressions are subjected to stepwise regression analysis to determine thc most significant determinants for each of the performance variables. The SYSTAT statistical package was used for all statistical analyses.
Results and discussion
As the effects of organizational variables (Xl-X6) upon the three performance variables are separately measurcd, the results and their discussion is also presented in three sections. Furthermore, since the focus of this paper rests upon identifying the most significant determinants of performance and evaluating their rela_tive importance rather than their predictive powers, the results are also presented in the form of standardized partial slopes (b-weights).* These estimates indicate the average deviation change in Y associated with a standard deviation change in X, when the other independent variables are held constant. The B-weights thus allow the relative values of different variables, even when measured on different scales as in the present study, to be determined and compared. Finally, as the directions of the relationships between the independent and the dependent variables is indicated a priori in the propositions, only one-tailed significance of the regression variables need to be tabulated.t
Determinants of cost-performance
The results of multiple and stepwise regression of the six independent variables upon cost-performance are presented in Table 1. The six variables accounted for over 81 % of the variance in the project organization's cost performance. This is a very high proportion of the total variance and the probability of it occurring due to chancc is less than 0.001. Nevertheless, it is important to note that only three variables, X3 (sufficiency of given information), X4 (time taken to procure further information), and X5 (Task's dependence upon others) have statistically significant impact upon the cost-performance in the traditional building process.
In terms of relative importance, the two independent variables comprising the 'domain consensus' (Xl + X2) are the least important organizational factors as far as the projects' cost-performance is concerned. The projects' two variables jointly account for only 8.1 % of the total variance.
The 'interdependence of tasks' group (X5 -h X6) accounts for 17.1 % of variance; however, X5 ('tasks' dependence upon others') alone accounts for 15% and therefore can bc considered to be a significant determinant of cost performance. The variables representing the 'Availability and access to information' (X3 + X4), on the other hand, account for over 55 0 of variance (X3 = 27.1, X4=28.1) and hence are the most significant variables.
It is obvious that with half of the variables in the model being insignificant, it is not a very efficient model. The stepwise regression removes the three insignificant variables — Xl, X2 and X6 — from the model and re-evaluates the impact of the remaining three variables.
*A standard score is a standard deviation score. If deviations from the mean, .x= X X, are divided by the standard deviation of the set of scores, s, standard scores are obtained.
$1n propositions where no direction or the relationship between the independent variables and the dependent variable is given, cwo-tailed significance values must be computed.

decisions to the quality-performance. The inclusion of X2 (extent of specialization) and A'3 (sufficiency of information) but not of X4 (time required to procure more information) suggests that the quality-performance is primarily aflécted by the earliest layouts of the process. In other words. if highly qualified task-organizations are selected and provided with sufficient information about their tasks, then high quality-performance would result. That such highly specialized task-organizations' work also needs to be integrated by some overall co-ordinative mechanism — a characteristic absent in the traditional building process evident in the inclusion of X5 as the most important determinant of quality-performance. It suggests here, just as for cost and time performances, that the high interdependence of tasks in the traditional building process is highly dysfunctional to the quality performance.

where design and manufacture is under a common responsibility, or where the use of complex components and assemblies has eliminated Inany on-site operations the interdependencc between the task organizations is already a less prominent factor. In other instances where these conditions do not exist. careful integrative and co-ordinative mechanisms must be created.
Thirdly, the importance of specialists should not be ignored. As the building industry is moving into an era of rapid absorption of innovations and has to deal with increasing demands of higher quality, the importance of the degrec of specialization as a determinant of performancc is likely to increase. Thus, we appear to have a blue-print for innovation and change in the traditional building process, where information (its quality and availability, along with process aggregation and greater specialist intervention) can lead to improved time cost and quality performance.
