One of the major methods of managing construction risks in the Nigerian construction industry is the insurance method. On the basis of data from some selected construction sites in Nigeria, this paper evaluates the effectiveness of the method. Also it identi es, through a questionnaire survey, the various insurable construction risks perceived to be encountered in the Nigerian construction industry and the types of insurance policy employed in managing them. High importance is placed by the construction industry on site security, construction risk, and health and welfare requirements, and the use of an all-risk insurance policy is the most prominent method for managing the identi ed risks. Finally it is concluded that there is a correlation between insured sum and actual replacement cost when there are losses or damages. However, the insurance claims settled could cater for only 61.1% of the replacement cost of on-going construction works studied.

Introduction
Risk is inherent in all human endeavours, including construction activities, and the risk elements involved are diverse and varied. The scope of building activities extends to risk management in planning, arranging and controlling activities and resources in order to minimise the impact of uncertain events. Risk in construction has been the object of attention because of time and cost over-runs associated with construction projects (Akintoye and MacLeod, 1997). McKim (1992), Healey (1982) and Perry and Hayes (1985) expressed risk as an exposure to economic loss or gain arising from involvement in the construction process, but Mason (1973) Moavenzadeh and Rossow (1976) regarded it as an exposure to loss only. According to McKim (1992), it is necessary to understand the nature of risk before any knowledgeable management of risk can occur. Risk comes in many forms, and often the very nature of risk depends on the situation. For example, health risks cannot generally be managed in the same manner as the risks associated with the transportation of toxic materials, and the risks associated with a space mission cannot be managed the same as construction risks.

Akintoye and Macleod (1997), Raftery (1994), Williams and Heims (1989) and Toakley and Ling (1991) identi ed the current usage or risk management techniques in the construction industry. These include risk premium, risk adjusted discount rate, subjective probability, decision analysis, sensitivity analysis, Monte Carlo simulation, stochastic dominance, Casper and intuition. However, in a study conducted by Odeyinka (1987) it was found that one of the major methods of managing construction risks in the Nigerian construction industry is through transfer to insurance companies. Until now the effectiveness of this method in managing construction risks in Nigeria has not been investigated. Therefore, the objectives of this paper are to identify the insurable construction risks perceived to be encountered in the Nigerian construction industry, examine how they are managed through insurance premiums and investigate the effectiveness of the use of insurance.
Data collection and methodology
In order to achieve the objectives of identifying the insurable construction risks and examining how they are managed through the insurance method, the study focused on construction contractors as respondents. This is because they cope with the risk in construction, although the clients pay for it. A total of 100 questionnaires were issued to Nigerian construction contractors using a strati ed random sampling technique. First the population of construction  rms surveyed was divided into the strata of large, medium and small  rms according to their registration categories under the Federal ministry of works’ categorization (Table 1). For the purpose of this study, those that registered under categories A and B were regarded as small  rms, those under category C as medium  rms while those under category D were taken as large  rms. The questionnaire survey was then issued to the strata in a random manner. Out of the 100 questionnaires, 72 were returned properly  lled and  t for analysis. This represents a 72% response rate. Respondents to the survey were: large  rms (n = 12), medium  rms (n = 25) and small  rms (n = 35).
The questionnaires were completed by top management in the  rms surveyed (mainly company directors and contract managers). Tables 2, 3 and 4 show some of the characteristics of the respondents as regards academic and professional quali cations plus work experiences. On the basis of these it is inferred that the respondents have adequate knowledge of construction and its attendant risks, and the data obtained from them through questionnaire survey may be relied on. Data obtained from the questionnaire survey were analysed using the risk premium index (RPI) method (Akintoye and Macleod, 1997). In this study, this method is referred to as risk rating index (RRI), so as to avoid ambiguity of meaning with the use of premium in insurance.
In order to evaluate the effectiveness of the insurance method in managing construction risks, data were collected from on-going construction projects. A research pro-forma was prepared to collect project data regarding: contract sum, insured sum, premium paid, claims settled, and actual replacement cost. Being a period of economic depression, not many new construction activities were going on in Nigeria. However, some commercial buildings were under construction in some major cities. As such, efforts were directed at obtaining project data from them. Research pro-formas were issued to contract managers on 50 construction sites in some major cites within the same cost zone. However, 32 responses  t for analysis were received representing a 64% response rate. The majority of the respondent (96.9%) were small and medium sized  rms (Table 1). Many contract managers claimed they were not prepared to divulge company ‘secrets’ and so did not complete their research pro-forma. Thus the study was based on the responses available. The projects surveyed are framed buildings of varying sizes but of comparable complexity and buildability. The data collected were analysed using simple linear regression in order to investigate statistical relationships.
Identi cation of sources of construction risks
Perry and Hayes (1985) and Mustafa and Al-Bahar (1991) have identi ed some risk sources central to construction activities. These are physical, environmental, design, logistics,  nancial, legal, political, construction and operation risks. McNulty (1980) and Carruth (1977) also identi ed some risk elements inherent in construction works. These include site security and health and welfare requirements.
Employing the above identi ed risk sources, the respondents were asked to indicate the importance they place on each, and their response is shown in Table 5. The importance placed by the contractors surveyed to perceived risk sources in construction is referred to as contractor’s ‘risk rating index’ (RRI). This was de ned by Akintoye and MacLeod (1997) as
where Ei is the ith extent of premium and Pi is the percentage of respondents. Table 5 shows that

contractors place the greatest importance on site security. This was followed by construction risks and health and welfare requirements. These are not unexpected: site safety was of paramount importance to contractors because in big cities in Nigeria the security of construction resources is a big problem. Any occurrence of threat to the security of construction resources could have grave consequences. Construction risk is important to the contractor as it affects the feasibility of construction methods, climatic quality and the extent of variation orders. Health and welfare requirements affect everyone who has a reason to be on site, such as employees, sub-contractors, third parties and other personnel. Any omission or breach of such requirements can have a signi cant effect on claims, especially if prosecution is involved. Therefore it is not surprising that constructors place a high degree of importance on it.

According to clause 2.1 of JCT (1980), ‘the contractor shall upon and subject to the conditions carry out and complete the Works in compliance with the Contract Documents, using materials and workmanship of the quality and standards therein speci ed’. Turner (1979) observed that if there is any damage to such work as described above, which must have been included in the work item rate calculation and/or contingency sum, the contractor will make it good at his own expense. This entails some risk-bearing responsibilities by the contractor. However, the standard form of building contract (JCT, 1980) in clauses 18,19,20,12 and 22 provided avenues whereby the risk-bearing responsibility can be transferred by the contractor to the insurance company.
Carruth (1977), Denenberg et al. (1974) and Turner (1979) have identi ed insurance employed in managing construction risks to include all-risk policies, road traf c act policies, multi-risk policies and speci ed peril policies. All-risk policies, according to Denenberg et al.(1974), cover all the risks in construction except those speci ed by exclusion clauses. According to him, multi-risk policies on the other hand specify a catalogue of an extensive number of perils such as  re, lightning, windstorm, explosion, death of workers, health, safety, welfare, and so on. Unlike all-risk policies, only speci c risks stated under multi-risk policies are covered, whereas the unspeci ed ones are not. According to Carruth (1977), speci ed peril policies state the peril covered but the insured absorbs any losses incurred from unspeci ed perils. These differ from multi-risk policies in that the peril covered may be only one. Road Transport Act (RTA) policies, according to Carruth (1977), are meant to protect items of plant which normally are expected to be on site only but which may quite unintentionally end up in circumstances to which the RTA applies. For instance, a labourer who, deciding to learn to drive a dumper on site, may lose control and injure a passer-by.
Table 6 shows the index of importance placed by construction companies on the types of insurance policy they employ. Contractors who were asked to indicate the extent of importance attached to the types of insurance policy employed in managing construction risks ranked the all-risk policy highest. This was followed by multi risk policy. An investigation of the reasons for the preference for an all-risk policy reveals the following: ease of settlement in cases of occurrence (2.60), speci city of the policy (3.20), coverage of broad risk (3.90) and convenience (4.10). Therefore it is obvious that the preference for all-risk policies is due largely to convenience and the coverage of broad risk factors. This con rms the submission of Denenberg et al.(1974) that all-risk policies are more effective in protecting the insured against all unplanned losses covered in construction works.
The effectiveness of the use of insurance in managing construction risks
In order to evaluate the effectiveness of the use of insurance in managing construction risks, data were sourced from 32 construction projects which were insured against all-risks and where the perils against which they were insured occurred. The contract sums for the projects studied ranged from N– 16 million to N– 115 million. The costs of insurance ranged from N– 245,000 to N– 2,600,000, with annual premium payment. Other project details are shown in Table 7 and the project characteristics were detailed in the section ‘Data collection and methodology’.
Employing the secondary data obtained through the research pro-forma (Table 7), two variables were identi ed for evaluating the effectiveness of the use of insurance in managing construction risks. These are claim settled (as determined by the loss adjusters) and actual replacement cost in cases of loss. In order to establish statistical relationship between these variables, simple regression analysis of actual replacement cost (Y) on claim settled (X) was carried out. The regression result obtained by SPSS computer software is represented in Table 8. The research hypothesis employed is that actual replacement cost has no significant relationship with the claim settled. Using the F-statistic, X (claim settled) variable shows a positive sign signi cant at the 5% level. This indicates that the study hypothesis is rejected and the alternative accepted that actual replacement cost has a signi cant relationship with the claim settled. Therefore it means that the variation in actual replacement cost is explained by the claim settled. It may be inferred that, within the limitation of the data collected, the claim settled under the use of insurance in managing construction risk is adequate for the cost of replacement in cases of occurrence of an insured peril. Corroborating this is the t-statistic of the X variable, which also shows a positive sign signi cant at the 5% level, meaning that there is a signi cant correlation between the actual cost of replacement and the claim settled. This is not surprising as it conforms with the a priori expectation of the insurance principle of indemnity. Also it explains why the use of insurance in managing risk in construction still ranks very high in the study area. Moreover, the coef cient of the variable X is positive and fairly high, indicating from the regression equation that the greater is the amount of the claim settled, the greater is the amount available as replacement cost. This implies that, since the claim settlement cannot be more than the insured sum, adequate care should be taken in determining the insured sum as eventually this will affect the claim settled, which is expected to be used to defray the cost of replacement in cases of loss or damage.
Furthermore, Table 8 reveals that while the  gures for the insured sums and claims settled are close enough, the differential between the claims settled and the actual replacement cost is considerable. This position is supported by the coef cient of determination R2 of 0.6105, which indicates that only 61.05% of the actual replacement cost is accounted for by the claim settled. The remaining 38.96% would have to be borne by the insured. This situation is not surprising as most contracts of insurance have exclusion clauses. The cost of remedying the occurrence of the perils listed in the exclusion clauses would have to be borne by the insured; hence, the cost of replacement exceeds the claim settled in all the cases studied.

Types of policy
This study has examined the sources of insurable construction risks perceived to be encountered in the Nigerian construction industry, and the types of insurance policy employed in managing them. The study shows that, out of the myriad of insurable risks, great importance is placed on site security, construction risks, and health and welfare requirements. The Nigerian construction industry has various types of insurance policy available. However, the most favoured for managing construction risk is the all-risk policy.

On the basis of the projects studied, this study concludes that actual replacement cost has a signi cant relationship with the claim settled. It concludes also that there is a signi cant correlation between the Table 8 Simple linear regression resultsa
actual cost of replacement and the claim settled. These suggest that, within the limitations of the data collected, the use of insurance is effective in managing construction risks in the study area.
In order that the use of insurance is effective in managing construction risks, it is recommended that considerable care should be taken in determining the insured sum. Also contractors should study the exclusion clauses carefully before entering into any contract of insurance. This will help ensure an awareness of uninsured risk exposure and will motivate contractors to seek avenues of protection other than insurance.
