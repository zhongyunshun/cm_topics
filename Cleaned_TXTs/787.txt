Building Information Modelling (BIM) is a well-known construction technology for improving management. Its implementation in Saudi Arabia’s construction industry is increasing as it adapts to futuristic construction management practices. This quantitative case study examines the factors that led to the success of employing the BIM tool in managing a recent home development project in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. After a survey of the available literature, 28 success criteria were identified and validated by an expert panel of 18 industry professionals. Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) is used to analyze data from a pilot survey of 132 people. A total of three factors are deleted because of factors leading to a value of less than 0.6. Further, there were 212 people who filled out the main survey questionnaire, and the data are analyzed using structural equation modeling (SEM). The findings show that BIM significantly improved the house development project in terms of cost, time, quality, safety, efficiency and environmental effect. Implications for management are highlighted, along with the study’s limitations and suggestions for further investigation. Overall, this research offers helpful information for residential building experts who want to make the most of BIM.

Introduction
The construction business is complicated and dynamic, with many variables influencing project timetables, quality, safety and prices. Building Information Modeling (BIM) may help manage building projects more efficiently and effectively [1,2]. BIM is used to manage two-story villas in Jeddah, saving time and money, among other benefits. BIM can solve these issues. BIM lets construction project managers simulate, visualize and evaluate their projects virtually. This platform integrates construction data seamlessly, improving stakeholder engagement and decreasing construction time and costs. BIM is beneficial in the early phases of building project design. Project managers may utilize BIM to construct comprehensive architectural models to spot concerns early on. Early detection helps save expensive redesigns and construction delays. BIM also lets project managers simulate and test design decisions to see how they could affect timelines and budgets [3,4].
BIM helped design the two-story residences in Jeddah by integrating construction data. BIM was used to assess design viability and identify concerns [5]. BIM helped project managers avoid expensive redesigns and delays by testing multiple design possibilities before construction. BIM also tracked the project’s progress and identified opportunities for improvement, saving time and money [6]. BIM enhanced stakeholder engagement and communication. BIM enabled real-time cooperation among stakeholders to accomplish goals. BIM helped designers, architects, builders and other stakeholders collaborate on the two-story homes in Jeddah. Collaboration improved project quality and reduced miscommunications [7,8]. BIM also improved project management by centralizing construction data. Project managers could track progress and make modifications by constructing a digital model of the construction project. This sped up construction and cut expenses.
BIM in building projects needs fixing [6,9]. BIM requires particular abilities. BIM requires extensive training for project managers. BIM integration with project management systems might require significant technology and software investments [10,11].
This case study shows how BIM saves time and money while building two-story residences in Jeddah. Two-story residential buildings are very common in the residential communities of all Saudi Arabia [12]. It is the reason that this study only involves two-story buildings, to effectively focus on the application of BIM. This case study uses structural equation modeling (SEM) to explore variable correlations and evaluate BIM implementation. SPSS and Smart PLS 4, popular data analysis tools, are utilized for SEM. SEM research shows that BIM improved the project results, construction time and cost. The results also demonstrate that stakeholder participation and communication were crucial to BIM deployment [13]. The report also emphasizes the necessity for stakeholder participation and project managers with BIM capabilities. SEM is a robust data analysis technique, but it has limits. SEM needs a significant sample size for accurate findings. Some businesses may need more experience and understanding to implement SEM. SEM may help evaluate BIM deployment in building project management despite these limitations. SEM helps construction professionals assess project success elements and improve. Therefore, this case study aims to show how BIM improves project management, construction timetables, quality, safety, the environment, costs and project results. It examines the merits of implementing BIM in building two-story homes in Jeddah. This case study can help construction professionals understand how BIM improves project results. Budget overruns, delays and quality control concerns affect the construction business. This case study shows how BIM saves time and money while building two-story residences in Jeddah. The report also emphasizes stakeholder participation and project managers’ BIM proficiency. SEM is used to evaluate BIM deployment and find areas for improvement. Construction professionals may choose the finest tools and tactics for project management by studying the pros and downsides of BIM and SEM.
Current Status of BIM in Jeddah
The construction sector has extensively embraced Building Information Modeling
(BIM) because it can improve project management and communication, decrease mistakes and rework, and improve project results [14]. BIM is a digital representation of a building or facility’s physical and functional qualities that may be utilized for design, construction and operational reasons. BIM has been proven to result in considerable time and cost savings for construction projects, as well as improved overall quality and safety. BIM’s capacity to enhance cooperation and communication among project stakeholders, including architects, engineers, contractors and owners, is one of its primary advantages [15,16]. Using a shared digital model, stakeholders may collaborate in real time and make choices based on accurate and current data. This decreases the possibility of mistakes, disputes and the requirement for rework, saving time and money [17,18]. Several studies have examined the advantages of BIM for building projects. In a case study, Lin et al. (2016) showed that the use of BIM on a healthcare project reduced the length of the design phase by 40 percent and the construction expenses by 20 percent [19].
Similarly, D. Liu et al. (2019) showed that the use of BIM on a commercial office building project reduced the number of Requests for Information (RFIs) by 50 percent and modification orders by 60 percent [20]. BIM has been shown to enhance project results in the setting of home buildings. Ahmad and Thaheem (2018) conducted a case study on using BIM to design and construct a single-family home in China [21]. The research concluded that BIM improved project coordination, decreased mistakes and rework, and increased project quality and safety. Another case study by Alothman et al. (2021) evaluated the application of BIM in South Korean affordable housing development and maintenance [22]. According to the report, BIM helped minimize construction waste and expenses and increase the project’s efficiency and sustainability. Some more critical relevant studies are shown below in Table 1.
