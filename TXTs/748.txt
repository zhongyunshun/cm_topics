Since 2015, the Chinese government has consistently underscored the advancement and integration of BIM technology, incorporating it into pivotal strategies for industrialized housing and progressive developments in the construction sector. Within the transportation domain, China’s Ministry of Transport actively champions the digital transformation of roads and the establishment of intelligent highways. These policies incentivize construction entities to synchronize planning efforts, formulate comprehensive life cycle models, engage diverse stakeholders, and digitalize engineering management to attain cost reduction and efficiency enhancement. Commencing June 2024, newly initiated national highway projects are mandated to submit BIM design results, while other projects are strongly encouraged to embrace BIM design  technology1. Looking ahead, a digitalized highway network is poised to become an integral element of emerging development paradigms.
Historical Development of BIM technology
BIM technology, represents a digitized approach to architectural design, construction, and operation grounded in digital technology. It streamlines the integration and management of information across the entire lifecycle of a construction  project2. The theoretical roots of BIM technology trace back to the 1970s in computer-aided design and the architectural domain. With enhanced computing capabilities and the evolution of 3D modeling technology, BIM has gradually surfaced. Its evolutionary stages encompass:
• Basic modeling In its initial phases, BIM technology predominantly involved 3D modeling for architectural design, replacing traditional 2D drawings.
• Multidimensional data integration Advancing BIM technology incorporated additional dimensions such as time, cost, and materials to bolster construction and management processes.
• Cloud computing and mobile applications In recent years, BIM technology has migrated to the cloud, fostering more convenient collaboration and supporting the development of mobile applications.
• Smart buildings and the IoT Presently, the fusion of BIM technology with the IoT propels smart building and equipment management, enhancing building efficiency and sustainability.
The application of BIM in architecture spans project stages, aiding feasibility analysis, simulation, optimization, and efficiency assessments for d esigners3–6. Construction teams use BIM for detailed design, simulation, schedule management, and resource scheduling, enhancing quality and  efficiency7,8.Operation teams rely on BIM for equipment management, energy monitoring, and maintenance, ensuring long-term  reliability9–12. BIM improves efficiency, quality, and collaboration, fostering transparency, traceability, customer satisfaction, and social responsibility.
BIM technology in road infrastructure
Highway construction confronts considerable challenges, demanding more efficient and precise construction management methods to meet requirements and uphold project quality. AngYang emphasizes the need to intensify BIM application in road i nfrastructure13. Instances of BIM technology applications in road infrastructure abound, with notable cases including:
• Hong Kong–Zhuhai–Macao Bridge (HZMB) Spanning 55 kilometers with bridges, tunnels, and artificial islands, employed BIM for design, construction, and maintenance. This enhanced collaboration, ensuring project quality, safety, and cost s avings14.
• Beijing daxing International Airport The world’s largest single-terminal airport, utilized BIM for planning, design, construction supervision, and maintenance. This integration boosted project efficiency and overall  benefits15.
• Shenzhen metro One of China’s largest metro projects, spanning 303 kilometers across 11 lines, prominently utilized BIM for simulation analysis and optimization in underground planning, route design, station layout, and tunnel construction. This proactive strategy effectively addressed challenges tied to complex geological conditions, significantly enhancing metro construction safety and r eliability16.
In the realm of road infrastructure, the application of BIM technology primarily emphasizes the following aspects:
• BIM in bridge engineering BIM technology in bridge engineering improves design quality, construction efficiency, progress control, and ongoing structural monitoring. ShenJian and team explored bridge construction safety management with BIM, leading to a proposed BIM-centric system for enhanced safety  measures17. Marzouk and Hisham delved into the application of BIM in cost and time management within bridge engineering, culminating in the development of a BIM-based bridge lifecycle cost m odel18.
• BIM in tunnel engineering BIM technology enhances tunnels by visualizing geological conditions, optimizing design, simulating construction, and managing maintenance. Cudrigh-Maislinger’s BIM pilot project, the Karawanken Tunnel, exemplifies BIM’s potential in overseeing complex infrastructure projects like tunnel  construction19. In the ambitious nearly 7-kilometer tunnel boring machine project in Berlin’s city center, Fentzloff amalgamated BIM with Lean principles, illustrating how the combined approach enhances tunnel construction efficiency, safety, and quality by minimizing waste, enhancing communication, and expediting decision-making20.
• BIM in road engineering Highways utilize BIM for efficient route planning, pavement design, construction, and ongoing monitoring. Researchers, including Vignali and Valeria, applied BIM to upgrade existing road infrastructure, creating 3D models for both old and new elements. Simulations and analyses for traffic, safety, environment, and economics led to optimized designs, reduced construction time and costs, and improved maintenance and management of road i nfrastructure21. Kohlböc demonstrated BIM’s application in building a 21-kilometer rail segment from Köstendorf to Salzburg, encompassing tunnels, bridges, and viaducts. The project utilized a digital parametric foundation model, integrating geological and geotechnical characteristics, for comprehensive design p recision22. Kim and colleagues applied BIM technology to a highway project, developing an object-based intelligent model capable of automatically obtaining cost and schedule estimates within the m odel23.
The widespread integration of BIM technology in the realm of road infrastructure yields myriad advantages for engineering projects, augmenting efficiency, quality, and contributing to the sustainable construction of road infrastructure. However, the implementation of BIM in the road infrastructure sector still faces many challenges.
• BIM was initially developed for vertical buildings; however, infrastructure such as roads, railways, airport runways, dams, and bridges possess linear characteristics and extensibility, making it challenging to model them using the same schemes and principles as building  BIM24. To address this issue, Barazzetti utilized GIS technology to provide precise geospatial data and analytical capabilities, supporting the efficient modeling and management of road  infrastructure25.
• The effective implementation of BIM, as an emerging technology, requires support from professional knowledge and skills. However, a lack of comprehensive BIM talent cultivation systems both domestically and internationally results in insufficient understanding and knowledge among participants, limiting the full potential of  BIM26,27.
• The involvement of multiple stakeholders in road infrastructure projects highlights the necessity for an effective communication and collaboration platform. Unfortunately, a unified BIM platform is lacking both domestically and internationally. Diverse stakeholders using different software and tools result in issues like information isolation, data redundancy, and version confusion, impacting collaborative management effectiveness 	28.
Despite the challenges, BIM technology is expected to continue playing a crucial role in the fields of building and road infrastructure, supporting more efficient and sustainable engineering management and construction. It offers new tools and methods for innovative applications in the comprehensive construction management of highways.
Project overview
The Yuan Chen Highway (Figure 1) stands as a significant road infrastructure endeavor situated in China. Commencing at Shuxi Kou in Pangu Township, Yuanling County, Hunan Province, it interconnects with the Changji Highway. The Highway traverses Changpo, Tianwan, the eastern sector of Chenxi County, Shibei, and culminates at Muqiaojiang in Huomachong Town, linking seamlessly with the Xuhuai Highway. The project is segmented into four distinct construction bid packages, with an anticipated total investment of 7.036 billion yuan. The mainline spans approximately 50.483 kilometers, and the construction timeline is set at 36 months, featuring a roadbed width of 26 meters. Designed as a dual two-lane configuration, the Highway boasts a designated design speed of 100 kilometers per hour.
Major projects
The Yuan Chen Highway encompasses several pivotal engineering components, including interchanges, tunnels, bridges, and service areas. These projects present specific technical challenges that necessitate innovative solutions. The distinct engineering components are detailed as follows:
• Interchange engineering The Highway boasts a total of six interchanges. Notably, the Chenxi Interchange adopts a single-column elevated bridge structure, featuring a mainline bridge length of 120 meters and a ramp bridge length of 60 meters.

incorporates integral lining of the arch wall. This process utilizes a full-section hydraulic formwork for stepby-step pouring.
• Bridge engineering The Highway incorporates six bridges, with particular emphasis on the Yuan River ExtraLarge Bridge as a critical control project. Linking Yuanling and Chenxi, this bridge spans the Yuan River, with a total length of 732 meters. It employs a continuous rigid frame bridge type, featuring separate lanes on the left and right.
• Service area engineering Singularly, the Highway accommodates one service area-the Chenxi North Service Area. Situated in Huomachong Village, Huomachong Town, Chenxi County, it stands as one of the inaugural main building projects of the Yuan Chen Highway.
Project characteristics
The project faces complex geological challenges, including subsidence areas, posing safety control difficulties. Segments from K32+050 to K33+500 show subsidence due to refractory clay mining, and areas from K12+700 to K13+200 reveal private coal mining. Among the 40 bridges, 24 are in karst or intense subsidence regions, requiring stringent embankment and bridge foundation treatments. Changpo Tunnel’s rock is mostly Grade V limestone, presenting challenges for construction safety.
   The project intersects with the existing Highway at multiple points, heightening safety risks during construction. Spanning six bridges across national and provincial trunk road S250, the Yuan Chen Highway faces complex road conditions and heavy traffic flow. Six interchanges, including two connecting to existing Highways, add intricacy and coordination challenges, elevating safety risks.
   The Yuan River Extra-Large Bridge, a control project, encounters challenges due to environmental constraints. Limited by the Yuan River channel, large lifting equipment and construction vessels are impractical. Consequently, the construction of pier 5’s steel cofferdam requires a “crawler crane modular assembly + jacking down” method, intensifying on-site construction challenges and precision control of cofferdam jacking.
Application of BIM technology
Within this project, a sophisticated BIM model was crafted through the integration of technologies like GIS and the IoT. This integration facilitated the creation of a multi-level, multi-dimensional digital management platform. This optimization significantly improved project process management and decision support systems, showcasing innovative implementation for the intelligent construction of the entire Yuanchen Highway through the utilization of BIM technology. Establishment of BIM model
To construct a comprehensive BIM model, advanced technologies, including 5G and drone technology, were harnessed in conjunction with conventional oblique photogrammetry techniques. The creation of an accurate three-dimensional reality model was facilitated through the application of Context Capture. Subsequently, Pointools and Descartes were employed to derive Digital Terrain Models (DTM) from map data. Interchange design utilized OpenBridge Modeler, tunnel modeling was executed using Rhino, and road and service area modeling were conducted with MicroStation and OpenRoads Designer. Lastly, Aglosgeo played a crucial role in establishing a geological model, harmonizing and aligning 3D models from diverse sources and types. This accomplished a seamless integration of 3D geological features, terrain, and real-world conditions, resulting in the development of a lifelike construction environment. The detailed process is elucidated in (Figure 2).
BIM detailed design
Parametric model establishment
The reinforcement modeling process in the project, involving considerations like shape, dimensions, and concrete beam sections, is complex and time-consuming. Details such as diameter, spacing, and connections are crucial. To enhance efficiency, a rapid reinforcement modeling plugin was developed using Grasshopper and Rhino software. This innovative tool simplifies the modeling process, providing an efficient and precise solution for reinforced structural design.
   Expanding the plugin’s application to MicroStation, a parametric section template for the bridge was created. Simultaneously, through OpenBridge Modeler, we achieved the parametric establishment of the bridge pier model. The integration of these five models resulted in the comprehensive modeling of the entire bridge main structure, as illustrated in (Figure 3). This innovative approach not only increased work efficiency but also ensured modeling accuracy and consistency.
Clash detection
Clash detection, facilitated by BIM technology, is a spatial analysis method for three-dimensional models that automatically identifies geometric clashes within locally sourced content. This process allows for the detection and resolution of conflicts and interferences in the design phase, thereby mitigating construction costs and risks, and enhancing engineering quality and efficiency.
   In this project, Bentley software was employed for clash detection, successfully identifying and resolving more than 50 clash issues (Figure 4), encompassing both hard and soft clashes. Timely grouping, marking, annotation, and resolution of clash issues were meticulously executed. The results were compiled into a comprehensive clash report, which underwent communication and negotiation with various discipline designers. The clash detection process played a pivotal role in ensuring the safety and reliability of node locations, optimizing the design, and ultimately improving construction efficiency.

Intelligent application of BIM models
Simulation of construction organization for key projects
Given the intricate nature of the Yuanchen Highway, we employed construction organization simulation animation to replicate key construction processes along the entire route. This animation, leveraging BIM technology, integrates the three-dimensional model of a structure with construction scheduling, presenting the construction process in an animated format. Its objectives encompass:
• Early identification and resolution of issues in design and construction, optimization of construction plans, cost savings, acceleration of construction progress, and control of construction quality.

Traffic diversions and detour routes were assessed visually through simulations based on traffic volume and road conditions, incorporating over 20 types of temporary facilities using BIM models. Four primary categories of temporary signs and more than 10 structural components were strategically arranged for safety and warning purposes. (Figure 9).
   Using the completed BIM model for dynamic display and visibility analysis, potential impacts of traffic organization schemes were predicted. Evaluating factors such as efficiency, safety, cost-effectiveness, sustainability, and stakeholder satisfaction led to adjustments in the scheme. This meticulous process ensured the selection
