In many parts of the world the collection of reliable national information on construction activity is not an easy task, and the measurement of comparable, cross-national data can be problematic. This paper considers possible strategies for the improvement of data collection systems in the context of user needs.Keywords: Construction activity, international comparability, statistical systems
The importance of measuring construction activityAn essential issue in consideration of the state of the construction sector and its relationship with the macroeconomy is measurement of the activity of the sector. The fact that data on construction activity are poor and erratic has been acknowledged for a long time: see, for e.g. Bon (1990) and Cannon (1994), who considers the usability aspects of existing public and private data and the failure of such data to meet the needs of its users, and Ruddock (2000). Meikle and Grilli (1999), in their study of the measurement of construction output in European countries, point out that construction output data are not consistent in content and there is no generally accepted standard international de nition.  Economists dealing with the construction sector are no different from those in any other area and need to be reassured that data are both valid and representative. The following rhyme (Chambers, 1997) succinctly presents this sentiment:*e-mail: l.ruddock@salford.ac.ukEconomists have come to feelWhat can’t be measured, isn’t real The truth is always an amount Count numbers, only numbers count.International comparabilityWhat is the purpose of making international comparisons of construction activity levels in different countries? A signi cant aim of any economist concerned with the international construction sector is to foster the collection of comparable data across nations, with two main objectives: (1) to allow comparability between countries (this makes for a greater understanding of an individual country’s construction sector in the context of its own economic development, and also permits benchmarking); and (2) to provide aggregation of data across countries (this enables a global picture to be formed, perhaps with a view to enabling international policy decisions to be made).  Collecting comparable data is fraught with dif culties but the measurement problems encountered are not a suf cient reason for abandoning cross-national research, with its growing importance in the context of globalization.

Limitations of existing data sourcesTo make possible international comparisons of the construction sector or to obtain an overview of the global picture, reliable detailed data are required. There are two major problems with the compilation of such data: (1) the use of a variety of statistical de nitions and accounting procedures; and (2) the problem of coverage. A fundamental principle of sources of data on construction activity produced by national statistical of ces is that of cial statistics are essential for obtaining a transparent picture of economies. The United Nations, in its Annual Yearbook of National Accounts, draws concepts and de nitions from the International Recommendations for Construction Statistics (United Nations, 1998). Unfortunately, there are still many differences in underlying concepts and de nitions for different countries. As far as the problem of coverage is concerned, a recent survey (see next section) took local knowledge to assess the ‘grey’ construction sector in speci c countries, and the results showed that even in developed countries this is a significant issue.The quality of statistical dataTo improve the quality of international (and national) data provision generally, Lievesley (2001) indicated that, although the term ‘quality’, when applied to of cial statistics, is dif cult to de ne, the following components should apply: (1) validity, (2) reliability, (3) currency, (4) clarity and transparency with respect to known limitations, and (5) comparability through adherence to internationally agreed standards. The appropriateness of these criteria in the context of construction data is apparent. In order to assess the current state of available data on the sector, the Council of the CIB, in 1998, rati ed the setting-up of a Task Group (TG31) to look at the development of macroeconomic information on the construction sector worldwide. This Task Group (Macroeconomic Data for the Construction Industry) has, as one of its operational objectives: ‘. . . investigation of the availability and use of macroeconomic data sources on the construction sector within the context of an overview of global economic trends in construction activity to include consideration of sector policy and state support issues, viewing construction industry development in the context of the national economy of the country’.  In pursuance of this objective, a questionnaire survey of experts was carried out by the Task Group in 1999 to gauge the current state of the availability and usefulness of published statistical information available to the construction macroeconomist at an international level.This involved canvassing the views of national experts, who have an understanding of individual data sets and their context and valid interpretation. Responses from experts in 43 countries were obtained, covering a wide spectrum of economic development. A detailed analysis of the results of the survey has been published by the CIB (Ruddock, 2000). Some of the  ndings of the survey (hereinafter referred to as the TG31 Survey) are brie y presented in this note.GlobalizationThe importance of globalization, especially its potential for construction industries in poorer countries through technology transfer, is stressed by Ofori (1994). The importance of relevant data for assessing such effects is of paramount importance, and governments cannot be relied upon as the only sources of useful information. Cannon (1994) pointed out that many industry users may be unaware of the availability of some information because the originating institution may not recognize the usefulness of disseminating the data to a wider audience.  In the TG31 Survey, the experts were asked about the provision of data by non-governmental agencies. The  ndings showed that in the industrially developed world there is a plethora of private organizations producing data on the national construction sector. These tend to be forecasting institutions, contractors’ organizations or information service providers. In some parts of the world (such as in transition economies), a comprehensive information system may not yet be fully developed; in others (such as South Africa) all the parts exist but need to be brought together to form a more integrated system; in many countries, though, a comprehensive information system on the construction sector does not exist, and the survey elicited opinion on the most feasible option for setting up such a system.  In those countries in which such a system remains undeveloped or underdeveloped, the preferred options for the  nancing of such a system vary, but the most favoured options indicated in the survey were: government  nancing through a public/private agency, a subscription applicable to users or a levy system on members of the industry.Improving the quality of construction data worldwide	555  On the necessary foundation of data collected purely on a country-by-country basis, it is easy to overemphasize national considerations. To take a global overview of construction activity, a strategy of gathering data individually by national agencies may not be the optimal approach. A radical reappraisal of the international data gathering system may be required to obtain a more comprehensive global picture. According to Keuning (2000): ‘Probably the best answer to the challenge globalization puts to statistical of ces is to do what companies do. They form all kinds of worldwide alliances and redistribute tasks among the constituent partners in order to save costs and to improve productivity. We should follow suit and think much more seriously about an international network . . . of international statistical of ces that collect the data where it is most appropriate, share the information with each other (with a guarantee as to their con dentiality!) and perhaps specialize in accordance with local circumstances and expertise.’ The bene ts from this type of cooperation are particularly relevant in the context of construction statistics.Information usersWho are the clients who use construction activity data in guiding their activities? In addition to government interest in statistical information for policy and forecasting purposes, Snyman (1999) identi ed four interested groups: (1) contractors, for information relating to the workload of the industry; (2) professionals, for activity planning; (3) construction materials manufacturers; and (4) consumers. Industry’s requirements are concerned with the optimization of asset use, training and manpower, performance monitoring vis-à-vis foreign competition and the development of appropriate strategiesThe move towards improved quality: a slow processConsideration of the concerns raised with respect to data availability, reliability and usage can be focused on a couple of speci c issues. First and foremost, there is an overriding need to improve existing national statistical systems. In order to demonstrate clearly the relative importance of construction output between countries, it is essential that a standard international de nition is established. Ensuring that all construction work is included means that care should be taken to allow for all work, whether formal or informal.  There already exists a standard de nition of construction activity. The following is recommended by the United Nations (1998) in the compilation of construction statistics: ‘Economic activity directed to the creation, renovation, repair or extension of  xed assets in the form of buildings, land improvements of an engineering nature and other such engineering constructions as roads, bridges, dams and so forth’. This is the de nition used in the interpretation of construction activity in the International Standard Industry Classi cation (ISIC) linked to the NACE standard classi cation used in the national accounts of most developed countries.  The important issue is that the national accounting statistics bodies of individual countries are able to obtain the necessary data in the appropriate format. Thus change has to come through the work of national statistics agencies and it is a common feature that many countries now utilize ISIC as the basis for compilation of construction industry data.  However, it is important to any user of national data concerned with international comparisons to know how far any individual country’s statistics differ from this standard. The UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs Statistics Division provides a registry of national classi cations, in which deviations from the NACE standards are indicated. Reference to the registry may be essential when matters of international comparability are concerned. For instance, the National Bureau of Statistics of China (NBS China, 2002) has utilized ISIC as the basis for revising industrialization classi cation since 1999: ‘drawing on the experience of foreign countries and with consideration of Chinese reality’. The Polish Classi cation of Activities (PCA) is based on NACE but detailed translations at low levels tend to be related to ‘kinds of activity characteristic of the Polish economy’ (United Nations, 2002). These are typical of countries with developing or transitional economies.  The ability to provide full conformity with the ISIC is still lacking to varying degrees in different countries, but at least the process is progressing. This leads on to the second issue, i.e. the work of national data collection agencies and the movement towards a single agency responsible for construction data in developing countries. This is a problem that has been visited before. Lopes (1998) referred to the inadequacy and rudimentary nature of data on the construction industry in developing countries and pointed out the lack of input– output data in such construction sectors. The uncoordinated collection of data via several agencies leads to unnecessary processing problems, which could be eradicated by the setting-up of a central national agency. Ofori (2000) proposed the notion of a ‘central data bank for construction’ and took this notion further, advocating the development of regional construction databases for groups of countries. He noted that, globally, the UN Centre for Human Settlements (Habitat) wishes to develop a computerized information base for the sector. The merits of a central agency for managing construction industry development in developing countries can be seen in the relatively recent establishment of the Construction Industry Development Boards of Malaysia and South Africa. These are organizations dedicated to the improvement of performance of the construction industry in their respective countries.556	RuddockDealing with the informal sector is a major concern in many countries, and the CIB Working Commission on Construction in Developing Countries has an agenda on the role of that sector, as discussed in its  rst Progress Report (Ofori, 2001). To understand how the sector operates, a notion of its scope is required.  The lobbying power of the CIB Groups together with the political power of Habitat may have some success in affecting the pace of improvement, but undoubtedly the main factor in enhancing data availability and quality will be the development of inexpensive, manageable IT systems for the collection, analysis and dissemination of data. Data on national accounts should be constructed in a manner capable of integrating and accessing microdatabases derived from administrative sources and large samples. If the national system cannot provide ef cient access to such detailed data, both business and governments will come to depend increasingly on private proprietary databases, and the advantages of an overall integrated system will be lost.ReferencesBon, R.
