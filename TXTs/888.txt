and (3) Define objective function that is optimized as a function of decision variables (maximized or minimized). (SeeFig. 1., Fig. 2.)
2. Literature review
Many Scholars has researched and dealt with the Linear Programming and they have studied many applications of Linear Programming and Operation Research in several field [1]. presented a simplified linear programming model having many management restrictions and it was formulated to solve construction problems using LINDO software. The model developed represents of this project [2]. considered rectilinear distance location problem, which yields to capacitated facilities location, to decrease total project cost. The problem is reformulated as linear mixed integer problem related to linear programming relaxation [3]. applied mathematical programming methods by recognized widely limitations. This researcher proposed multi-mode technique depends on linear and/or integer programming for improving project cost and time. More modules were used for this study: (1) Duration, (2) Reduction, and (3) adjustment models [4]. reviewed linear programming as mathematical procedures that needed to obtain variables, constraints and feasible solutions [5]. presented workforce planning and operations research applications to explore general

potential modeling. Operations research was applied four major techniques: (1) Simulation models, (2) Supply chain models (3) Optimization models and (4) Markov models,. It concerned with important theory that provides integer programming with optimizing decisions mechanism for complex systems [6]. was concerned with cost or/and time which are major criteria that must considered carefully for construction scheduling with pricing. Construction managers should trying to find optimal project duration corresponding with minimum project cost that is solved by LINGO 12.0 [7]. Proposed a new optimum technique especially in fuzzy environment cost and time trade-off problems. For goal programming problems, it was developed new solution technique [8]. got and analyzed linear programming problems that were solved by original simplex algorithm [9]. presented a simplex algorithm that gives more solutions and taking advantage of minimizing construction operations based upon rational arithmetic [10]. mentioned project important factors to provide skilled labor related to its requirements. Linear programming was done to achieve optimized solution [11]. Linear algorithms in linear programming are presented and they are applicable for other problems as quadratic programming [12]. applied fuzzy theory for more construction fields, and presented more new solving fuzzy methods for construction by linear ranking function [13]. solving nonlinear problems complexity were reduced by transformations actions from nonlinear to integer linear

The primary research scope is to review solving method of The Linear Programming Models (Graphical Solution, Simplex Method, and Binary Variable) and discuss The Applications of The Linear Programming in The Project Management Office (PMO) to provide useful information for establishing data. Therefore, this study constitutes a wide review of literature including more cases of studies.
4. Methodology
This Research presents realistic Linear Programming models that define the variables and problem constraints also objective function for construction which are not straightforward. Firstly, it should understand what is Operation Research and Linear Programming where that it’s Mathematical modeling is a cornerstone to solve more Problems and making a decision before a final decision can be reached. All techniques include the following: (1) Non-Linear Programming (2) Dynamic Programming, (3) Network Programming, finally (4) Integer Programming. They are trying to find functional relationships between all variables and defining real World boundaries [17], The principal phases for the implementation of operation research model in practice include the following: (1) Definition, (2) Construction, (3) Solution, (4) Validation and (5) Solution Implementation.
5. Linear programming applications
Ready mix produces two types of paints, first one is interior paint and second one is exterior paint. They are produced from two raw materials. Following table give all limitations of problem:
   Interior paint maximum demand per day is equal to 2 tons. Also, interior paint daily demand cannot exceed by 1 ton than exterior paint. Ready mix wants to get optimal product mix from exterior and interior products that increase daily profit. The studied model had three items: (1) Decision variables, (2) Constraints and (3) Objective (maximize or minimize).
   It must be to get optimal feasible solution that maximizes the total profit and must be locate the optimum solution.
5.1. Graphical method
& Feasible area can be founded in Fig. 3. First, account the non-negativity constraints X1  0 and X2  0. Two axis x1 and x2 represent two variables. To plot all constraints, replace inequality to equation and plot it into graph. Any point inside or border of ABCDEF area is feasible solution. & Determination of Optimum Solution as shown in Fig. 3. Any point on area boundary of ABCDEF may one of them to can find optimum solution by solve profit function z = 5 X1 + 4 for maximizing objective function.
& Optimum solution can be found at point C, X1 and X2 values corresponding to point C were calculating equations: 5.0 X1 + 4.0 X2 = 24.0 and 1.0 X1 + 2.0 X2 = 6.0.
& The solution of point C (3, 1.5) give daily profit is equal to $21,000.
& The benefit of optimum solution that is located at corner point only. (See Fig. 4).
   Properties of the linear programming model: (1) Proportionality: it requires every decision variable contribution in constraints and objective function which directly proportional to variable value. (2) Additivity: it requires all variables contribution constraints and objective function which directly each variable individual contributions summation. (3) Certainty: Linear Programming model constraint coefficients and objective were deterministic. 5.2. Software solution (TORA)
(See-Fig. 5., Fig. 6.).
5.3. Simplex method and sensitivity analysis
Simplex technique was invented to solve problems that related to linear programming [18]. This technique had developed to solve complex problems using more variables with limitations and constraints. Simplex method begin from origin then moves from next corner point and so on for increasing objective function value, simplex method is used to optimize linear programming associated with complex problems using more decision variables number, it will be restricted the use of problems with

four variables or less based on sensitivity analysis to optimize project cost.
5.3.1. Simplex method Form
Two requirements must be done as: (1) Variables are nonnegative. (2) Constraints are presented as equations.
5.3.2. Converting inequalities to equations
In less than or equal constraints, right-hand side present resource availability by using of model. To convert less than or equal inequality constrain into simplified equation, it must be add non-negative slack variable at constraint left-hand side. As shown in Table 1, it will be solved the illustrative example by using simplex method, then Table 4 shows the simplex equation forms. (See-Table 2., Table 3.)
   Three equations with five unknowns (X1, X2, S1, S2 and S3). If unknowns number more than equations number, there will be many solutions available at this model. It can be represented the initial Simplex Table as shown in Table 5.
   Table 6 was designed to specify Basic and Non-basic Variables and to provide at the origin (X1, X2) = (0, 0) starting iteration solution as (1) Non-basic variables: (X1, X2), 2) and Basic vars. are S1 & S2 & S3 and S4. In case of non-basic vars. are X1 = 0.0 and X2 = 0.0 then Z = 0.0 & S1 = 24.0 & S2 = 6.0 & S3 = 1.0 and S4 = 2.0. Objective function Z = 5.0 X1 + 4.0 X2 presents that any result can increase in case of increasing X1 or/and X2. While X1 is better than X2 because of its high positive coefficient inside objective function and it is selected as entering variable, then it will assigned to high negative coefficient at new objective function optimality

   The minimum non-negative ratio automatically will convert leaving var. S1 with entering var. X1 with corresponding new value. Fig. 7. shows computed ratios using intercepts of constraints and entering variable (X1) axis. It can be produce following sets for Non-basic and basic variables: (1) Non-basic variables: (S1, X2), 2) Basic variables: (X1, S2, S3, S4). Basically it must be to determine column of entering var. as pivot column and row of leaving var. as pivot row. Intersection between

   It is important to generate new basic solution which it include: (1) Pivot row: switch leaving var. at basic column with entering var. by new pivot row isequal to current pivot row divided by pivot element as shown in next calculations. (2) All next new rows and Z row as New Row is equal to current row minus its pivot column coefficient multiply to new pivot
row [19,20]. (See-Fig. 8.)

X2 and S1 are equal to zero, also new basic solution of X1 = 4.0 & S2 = 2.0 & S3 = 5.0 & S4 = 2.0 and Z = 20, which is consistent with New Z = 0 + 4  5 = 20.

Then corresponding increase of Z is 2/3 and X2 = 2/3  1.5 = 1.0, that give new Z = 20.0 + 1.0 = 21.0.
Replacing leaving var. S2 with entering var. X2, the following Gauss-Jordan row operations are done as: 1) New pivot X2-row = Current S2-row/(4/3). 2) New Z-row = Current Zrow – (-2/3)  New X2-row. 3) New X1-row = Current X2-row – (2/3)  New X2-row. 4) New S3-row = Current S3row – (5/3)  New X2-row. 5) New S4-row = Current S4-row– (1)  New X2-row. These computations produce the following Table 10:

Finally Table 10 is converted to optimal solution table, then optimal values for studied problem are shown in Table 11.

(See-Fig. 9., Fig. 10.)
5.5. Minimization of linear simplex technique
For minimization problems optimality select entering var. as non-basic variable with objective function in most positive coefficient and opposite rule for maximization problems such as maximize of Z is equivalent to minimize of (-Z). In feasibility condition maximization or minimization problem is non-basic var. that had max negative or positive coefficient at z-row. Optimum at z-row coefficients iteration are nonnegative or non-positive. For maximization or minimization problems, basic variable (leaving) assigned with smallest non-negative ratio or positive ratio. Pivot row: Replace the leaving variable in the Basic column with the entering variable.
New pivot row is equal to old pivot row divided by pivot element. Then the remaining rows, including z: New row is equal to old row minus (pivot column coefficient) multiply (New pivot row). Finally simplex steps are: (1) Determine starting solution of basic feasible. (2) Select entering var. using optimality condition. Stop in case of no entering var. and last solution is optimal. (3) Feasibility condition will select leaving var. (4) Determine new basic solution and repeat by go to step 2
[21,22].
6. Case study
Project Selection with Competition at Limit Resource Using Linear Programming as Contractor View. Project Management Office has five bids and must make a decision to enter all of them or some of them or none of them with the note: (1) There is competition between the bidders. (2) Is the amount of existing resources enough or not enough. Table 12 gives problem basic data. The Bid Bonding is 0.2% of the amount of the tender and the Exposure Limit is 18 million. The following table provides the available resource which that Project Management Office Company has owned: 4 cranes, 3 aircompressors and 2 tractors.
   It is required to determine which projects the company can entering it to give maximum profit through their resource.
