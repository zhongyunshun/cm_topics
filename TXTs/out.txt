Acknowledgements	   	   First	    of	    all,	    I	    would	    like	    to	    thank	    my	    Supervisor	    Prof.	    Lauri	    Koskela,	    for	    his	   excellent	    and	    sincere	    support	    during	    my	    PhD	    and	    research	    under	    his	    capable	   guidance.	    I	    am	    indebted	    to	    Prof.	    Koskela	    for	    giving	    me	    freedom	    while	    pursuing	   research,	   and	   providing	   prompt	   guidance	   when	   needed.	    	   I	    am	    also	    thankful	    to	    the	    Salford	    Centre	    for	    Research	    and	    Innovation,	    where	    I	   worked	   as	   a	   researcher	   during	   my	   PhD,	   for	   funding	   my	   research	   and	   the	   excellent	   support	   I	   received	   during	   my	   employment.	   I	   would	   especially	   like	   to	   acknowledge	   Prof.	   Mike	   Kagioglou	   and	   Prof.	   Carl	   Abbott	   for	   their	   help	   and	   support,	   and	   also	   all	   of	   my	   colleagues	   and	   friends	   at	   SCRI,	   including	   Bob	   Owen,	   Patricia	   Tzortzopoulos-­Fazenda,	    Karen	    West,	    and	    Ricardo	    Codinhoto,	    for	    the	    invaluable	    friendship.	    A	   special	    thanks	    to	    Stefan	    Boddy,	    whose	    patient	    and	    efficient	    programming	    skills	   were	   helpful	   in	   realising	   the	   VisiLean	   prototype,	   who	   also	   put	   up	   with	   my	   endless	   requests	   for	   new	   features.	   I	   would	   like	   to	   thank	   all	   the	   supporting	   organisations	   and	   the	   team	   members	   that	   took	   part	   in	   the	   research,	   as	   without	   their	   support	   this	   research	   would	   not	   have	   been	    possible	    as	    intended.	    In	    particular,	    I	    would	    like	    to	    thank	    Derek	    Drysdale,	   Andrew	    Wingrove	    and	    Katie	    Jones	    from	    the	    Highways	    Agency,	    UK.

It	    has	    been	    an	    immense	   pleasure	   in	   discussing	   exciting	   research	   ideas	   and	   collaborating	   during	   the	   early	   stages	   of	   my	   research.	   Finally,	    I	    would	    like	    to	    thank	    my	    wife	    Kiran	    and	    daughters	    Nitya	    and	    Uditi,	    for	   putting	   up	   with	   me	   and	   for	   supporting	   me	   during	   my	   PhD,	   especially	   as	   there	   has	   been	   long	   and	   odd	   hours,	   and	   many	   absences	   from	   home.	   I	   would	   also	   like	   to	   thank	   my	   parents,	   who	   instilled	   the	   importance	   of	   chasing	   my	   ideas	   and	   for	   being	   there	   for	   me.	   Dedication	   	   	   	   	   	   To	   the	   memory	   of	   my	   grandmother

Specifically,	    the	    area	    of	    production	    management	    and	    control	    is	    addressed	    by	   developing	    a	    prototype	    software	    system	    that	    supports	    Lean	    Construction	   processes	   and	   provides	   a	   visual	   interface	   through	   Building	   Information	   Modelling.	    	   The	    research	    addresses	    a	    practically	    relevant	    problem,	    and	    follows	    the	    Design	   Science	   Research	   method.	   The	   first	   stage	   of	   the	   research	   explores	   the	   problem	   area	   through	    the	    author’s	    own	    observation	    of	    industrial	    practice,	    and	    also	    through	    a	   literature	    review.	    At	    the	    broad	    level,	    a	    two-­‐fold	    problem	    is	    identified;	    first	    the	   problems	    with	    the	    production	    management	    process	    itself,	    and	    second	    the	   problems	    with	    visualisation	    and	    management	    of	    the	    product	    model	    and	    its	   integration	   with	   the	   production	   management.	   At	   the	   fundamental	   level,	   it	   is	   found	   that	    many	    of	    these	    problems	    are	    linked	    with	    the	    deficient	    theory	    behind	   production,	    which	    is	    predominantly	    based	    on	    the	    “Transformation”	    view	    of	   production.	    Additionally,	    it	    is	    found	    that	    the	    previous	    attempts	    at	    solving	    the	   problems	   of	   construction	   management	   through	   information	   systems	   have	   only	   met	   with	   limited	   success	   as	   they	   mostly	   address	   the	   peripheral	   processes	   rather	   than	   the	   core	   area	   of	   production	   management.	   The	   second	   stage	   of	   the	   research	   explores	   and	   puts	   forward	   potential	   solutions	   to	   overcome	    the	    problems	    of	    production	    management.	    Lean	    Construction	    is	   identified	    as	    a	    partial	    solution	    to	    the	    production	    planning	    and	    control	    process.	   Specifically,	   the	   Last	   Planner	   System™	   of	   production	   control	   is	   found	   to	   improve	   the	   productivity	   and	   efficiency	   of	   the	   production	   process	   by	   reducing	   variability,	   improving	   reliability	   and	   collaboration	   and	   introducing	   continuous	   improvement.	   At	   the	   same	   time,	   it	   is	   found	   that	   Building	   Information	   Modelling	   helps	   overcome	   many	   of	   the	   problems	   found	   with	   the	   traditional	   product	   management	   techniques	   (such	   as	   2D	   and	   3D	   CAD),	   by	   providing	   an	   object	   oriented,	   parametric	   and	   visual	   representation	    of	    the	    product.	    It	    is	    also	    found	    that	    the	    application	    of	    Building	   Information	    Modelling	    is	    relevant	    to	    all	    aspects	    of	    the	    construction	    process.	   Through	    a	    conceptual	    analysis,	    significant	    synergies	    between	    Lean	    Construction	   and	   Building	   Information	   Modelling	   are	   identified,	   with	   applications	   also	   spanning	   the	   entire	   construction	   lifecycle.	   Specific	   benefits	   to	   the	   production	   management	   process	    are	    also	    found,	    backed	    by	    empirical	    evidence.	    However,	    it	    is	    also	    found	   that	   the	   current	   Building	   Information	   Modelling	   systems	   do	   not	   fully	   support	   an	   integrated	   implementation	   of	   production	   management.	   This	   particular	   aspect	   of	   an	   integrated	    and	    visual	    system,	    which	    would	    support	    the	    core	    production	   management	   process,	   is	   identified	   as	   a	   potential	   solution	   area.	   The	   third	   stage	   of	   the	   research	   is	   dedicated	   to	   the	   design	   and	   development	   of	   a	   software	    system	    called	    VisiLean,	    which	    provides	    a	    collaborative	    planning	    and	   control	    platform,	    which	    is	    integrated	    with	    the	    Building	    Information	    Modelling	   platform,	    and	    which	    supports	    the	    production	    management	    process.	    A	    prototype	   system	    is	    developed	    through	    an	    iterative	    and	    incremental	    process,	    through	   simultaneous	   feedback,	   evaluation	   and	   review.	   The	   fourth	   stage	   of	   the	   research	   includes	   the	   evaluation	   of	   the	   VisiLean	   prototype	   through	    a	    demonstration	    and	    feedback	    process.	    At	    this	    stage,	    the	    design,	   development	    and	    evaluation	    process	    is	    analyzed	    and	    discussed.	    Finally,	    the	   contributions	   to	   the	   theory	   and	   the	   body	   of	   knowledge	   are	   identified,	   along	   with	   the	   suggestions	   for	   future	   development.
1	   Introduction	   1.1 Background	   The	    problems	    faced	    by	    the	    construction	    industry	    are	    well	    known	    both	   internationally	    and	    in	    the	    UK.	    Some	    of	    the	    most	    criticised	    issues	    within	    the	   industry	   are:	   • Inefficient	    (wasteful)	    processes:	    The	    construction	    process	    is	    highly	   inefficient.	    In	    terms	    of	    productivity,	    a	    meta-­‐analysis	    of	    wasted	    time	    in	   construction	   was	   conducted	   by	   Horman	   and	   Kenley	   (2005),	   where	   the	   authors	   reported	   that	   over	   the	   last	   30	   years,	   almost	   49.6%	   of	   time	   was	   wasted	   during	   construction	   in	   non-­‐value	   adding	   activities.	   Similarly,	   a	   research	   carried	   out	   in	   Sweden	   showed	   that	   only	   15-­‐20	   %	   of	   the	   workers	   time	   is	   spent	   in	   direct	   work	   (i.e.	   carrying	   out	   the	   planned	   activity)	   (Jongeling	   &	   Olofsson	   2007).	   There	   are	   similar	    studies	    around	    the	    world,	    which	    have	    reported	    sub-­‐optimal	   performance	    of	    construction	    projects	    in	    terms	    of	    productivity	    and	    efficiency	   (Teicholz	   et	   al.,	   2001,	   Ramaswamy	   and	   Kalindi,	   2009).	   A	   separate	   study	   in	   USA	   in	    the	    productivity	    of	    non-­‐agricultural	    industries	    has	    found	    that	    the	   construction	    industry	    has	    actually	    seen	    a	    decline	    in	    productivity	    over	    recent	   years	   (Teicholz	   et	   al.,	   2001).	    	   • Cost/time	    overruns:	    Seldom	    does	    a	    construction	    project	    finish	    within	    time	   and	   budget	   (Ahmed,	   et	   al.,	   2003;	   Chan	   and	   Kumaraswamy,	   1996).	   This	   results	   in	    penalties	    to	    contractors	    and	    on	    many	    occasions,	    lengthy	    legal	    disputes	   within	   the	   supply	   chain	   as	   everyone	   tries	   to	   find	   a	   way	   to	   recover	   losses	   and	   someone	   to	   blame.	   • Fragmentation:	    Fragmentation	    is	    a	    factor	    that	    contributes	    to	    some	    of	    the	   problems	   listed	   above.	   Due	   to	   the	   risk	   aversion	   strategies	   of	   the	   construction	   firms,	   they	   are	   now	   merely	   planning	   and	   management	   companies	   who	   employ	   large	   number	   of	   specialised	    subcontractors	    on	    a	    typical	    construction	    project.	   This	   combined	   with	   other	   supply	   chain	   members	   such	   as	   architects,	   engineers	   and	    material	    suppliers;	    it	    makes	    it	    a	    highly	    fragmented	    and	    complicated	   industry	   (Harvey,	   2000).	   • Technological	   aversion:	   Construction	   is	   also	   seen	   as	   an	   industry,	   which	   lags	   behind	    other	    industries	    such	    as	    manufacturing	    in	    terms	    of	    technological	   adaptation.	   In	   general,	   there	   has	   been	   an	   active	   effort	   by	   the	   industry	   in	   recent	   years	   to	   implement	   technological	   solutions	   to	   improve	   the	   process,	   but	   due	   to	   misguided	    efforts,	    the	    results	    have	    not	    been	    satisfactory	    (Koskela,	    and	    Kazi	   2003;	   Tatari	   et	   al.,	   2006).	   It	    is	    equally	    important	    to	    understand	    the	    critical	    success	    factors,	    as	    it	    is	    to	   understand	    the	    root	    causes	    of	    failure	    on	    construction	    projects.	    Zhang	    (2005)	   reports	    on	    a	    survey	    carried	    out	    with	    construction	    managers	    to	    identify	    success	   factors	    behind	    desirable	    outcomes	    on	    construction	    projects.	    The	    top	    five	    factors	   outlined	   are:	   1. Planning	   &	   control	   2. Communication/coordination	   3. Labour	   availability	   and	   quality	   4. Equipment	   and	   tools	   (availability)	   5. Working	   methods.	    	   The	   first	   two	   factors	   mentioned	   above	   are	   significant	   as	   they	   govern	   the	   overall	   construction	   process	   and	   also	   affect	   the	   next	   three	   success	   factors	   up	   to	   a	   degree.	   This	   is	   due	   to	   a	   culmination	   of	   several	   factors	   that	   have	   weakened	   the	   production	   management	    processes.	    In	    a	    study	    of	    the	    main	    root	    causes	    of	    failure	    behind	   construction	    activities,	    Koch	    (2005)	    reports	    production	    planning	    and	    control,	   communications	    and	    cooperation,	    and	    design	    activities	    as	    the	    main	    factors	   contributing	    to	    problems.	    In	    construction,	    the	    traditional	    planning	    and	    control	   processes	    and	    also	    the	    communication/coordination	    between	    stakeholders	    have	   been	    problematic	    (Sacks	    et	    al.,	    2010a;	    Navon	    and	    Sacks,	    2007;	    Sarhan	    and	    Fox,	   2012).	    	   Looking	   specifically	   at	   the	   problems	   in	   the	   UK,	   compared	   to	   the	   global	   industry,	   there	    are	    both	    overlapping	    and	    specific	    problems.	    The	    problems	    faced	    by	    the	   construction	   industry	   in	   the	   UK	   are	   also	   raised	   in	   several	   high	   profile	   reports	   that	   have	    been	    published	    over	    the	    years,	    which	    highlight	    the	    inefficiencies	    with	    the	   construction	    industry.	    These	    include	    reports	    such	    as	    Constructing	    the	    Team	   (Latham,	    1994),	    Rethinking	    Construction	    (Egan,	    1998)	    and	    Accelerating	    Change	   (Egan,	   2002),	   which	   have	   highlighted	   key	   issues	   faced	   by	   the	   industry	   namely,	   the	   fragmentation,	   low	   and	   unpredictable	   profitability,	   low	   investment	   in	   innovation,	   and	   focus	   on	   cost	   rather	   than	   quality	   which	   all	   contribute	   up	   to	   a	   degree	   to	   failure.	   Latham’s	    report	    was	    the	    initial	    catalyst	    in	    starting	    the	    change	    process	    for	   construction	    industry.	    The	    report	    focussed	    mainly	    on	    collaboration	    within	    the	   team	   stating	   that	   up	   to	   30%	   savings	   could	   be	   achieved	   in	   five	   years.	   In	   Rethinking	   Construction	    (Egan,	    1998),	    which	    focussed	    strongly	    on	    processes	    and	   collaboration,	   five	   key	   drivers	   for	   change	   were	   identified.	    	   1. Committed	   leadership	    	   2. Focus	   on	   the	   customer	   3. Product	   team	   integration	   4. Quality	   driven	   agenda	   5. Commitment	   to	   people	   The	   report	   also	   identified	   four	   process	   improvement	   proposals:	   1. Product	   development	   2. Partnering	   in	   the	   supply	   chain	   3. Project	   implementation	   &	   4. Production	   of	   components	   (offsite)	   The	   Egan	   report	   also	   recommended	   implementation	   of	   Lean	   principles	   to	   improve	   process	    efficiency	    of	    the	    construction	    process.	    There	    has	    been	    a	    drive	    to	   implement	   Lean	   Construction	   in	   the	   UK	   due	   to	   the	   significant	   emphasis	   placed	   on	   implementation	    of	    lean	    principles	    in	    the	    construction	    industry,	    ever	    since	    the	   publication	    of	    these	    reports.	    This	    has	    been	    reflected	    in	    several	    training	    and	   implementation	    programmes	    such	    as	    the	    Construction	    Lean	    Improvement	   Programme	   (CLIP)	   that	   has	   been	   offered	   by	   the	   Buildings	   Research	   Establishment	   (BRE)	   since	   2003,	   and	   recently	   the	   BuildLean	   guide	   (Terry	   and	   Smith,	   2011)	   by	   Construction	   Industry	   Research	   and	   Information	   Association	   (CIRIA).	   Also,	   to	   help	   disseminate	   lean	   construction	   practices	   in	   the	   UK,	   a	   non-­‐profit	   organisation	   Lean	   Construction	   Institute	   (UK),	   has	   been	   established.	    	   The	    Accelerating	    Change	    (2002)	    report	    also	    highlighted	    problems	    with	    the	   construction	   supply	   chain	   and	   recommended	   that	   the	   industry	   should	   aim	   to	   take	   measures	   to	   improve	   the	   collaboration	   within	   the	   supply	   chain.	   It	   set	   the	   target	   of	   20%	   of	   projects	   to	   be	   undertaken	   by	   integrated	   teams	   by	   2004	   and	   50%	   by	   2007.	   However,	   even	   though	   the	   above	   mentioned	   reports	   have	   been	   able	   to	   kick	   start	   an	   improvement	   process	   across	   the	   industry,	   and	   several	   organisations	   such	   as	   the	   aforementioned	    Lean	    Construction	    Institute	    (UK)	    have	    been	    established,	    the	   uptake	   of	   lean	   construction	   in	   the	   UK	   has	   been	   quite	   slow	   and	   the	   industry	   has	   not	   met	    the	    targets	    by	    a	    considerable	    margin	    as	    reported	    by	    the	    recently	    published	   report	    “Never	    Waste	    a	    Good	    Crisis”	    (Wolstenholme	    et	    al.,	    2009).	    In	    the	    report,	   results	   from	   an	   extensive	   online	   survey	   were	   published,	   which	   was	   completed	   by	   nearly	   1000	   professional	   people	   from	   the	   industry.	   The	   survey	   gathered	   opinions	   across	    the	    industry	    about	    progress	    made	    since	    the	    Egan	    report	    and	    also	    put	   industry	    performance	    data	    in	    context	    to	    highlight	    key	    issues	    prevailing	    in	    the	   industry.	    Figure	    1.	    Perception	    of	    main	    benefits	    of	    the	    Rethinking	    Construction	   agenda	   (Wolstenholme,	   2009)	   demonstrates	   the	   perception	   of	   the	   industry	   of	   the	   benefits	   that	   have	   been	   brought	   by	   the	   Rethinking	   Construction	   agenda.	   The	    general	    perception	    that	    emerged	    from	    the	    survey	    was	    that	    while	    there	    are	   pockets	    of	    excellence,	    the	    majority	    of	    the	    industry	    hasn’t	    changed	    significantly.	   Also	   the	   KPIs	   (Key	   Performance	   Indicators)	   monitored	   since	   last	   10	   years	   confirm	   the	    findings	    as	    demonstrated	    by	    Figure	    2.	    Industry	    performance	    since	    1999	   (Wolstenholme,	   2009)	   Here	   it	   can	   be	   clearly	   seen	   that	   the	   “time	   saving”	   target	   set	   by	    Egan	    (as	    shown	    by	    pale	    blue	    line)	    is	    only	    partially	    met	    by	    selected	   demonstration	    projects	    (as	    shown	    by	    light	    blue	    bars),	    whereas	    the	    industry	   average	   remain	   relatively	   unaffected	   (dark	   blue	   bars).	   			   Figure	    1.	    Perception	    of	    main	    benefits	    of	    the	    Rethinking	    Construction	    agenda	   (Wolstenholme,	   2009).	    Figure	   2.	   Industry	   performance	   since	   1999	   (Wolstenholme,	   2009).	   The	    report	    claims	    that	    the	    stated	    aim	    of	    genuinely	    changing	    the	    nature	    of	    the	   construction	   industry	   has	   not	   been	   met	   and	   that	   there	   is	   not	   enough	   evidence	   of	   a	   genuine	   intent	   to	   change	   across	   the	   construction	   industry	   to	   achieve	   the	   targets	   set	   by	   Egan’s	   vision	   of	   the	   modern	   construction	   industry.	    	   There	   are	   several	   suggestions	   made	   by	   these	   reports	   as	   noted	   above,	   however,	   one	   of	    the	    common	    suggestions	    across	    all	    reports	    is	    that	    of	    the	    need	    to	    improve	   process	   efficiency	   and	   collaboration	   between	   the	   supply	   chain	   members	   through	   the	   application	   of	   lean	   construction.	    	   Although	   there	   are	   many	   tools	   and	   techniques	   associated	   with	   Lean	   Construction,	   one	    of	    the	    most	    implemented	    and	    effective	    tools	    in	    Lean	    Construction	   implementation	    is	    The	    Last	    Planner	    System™	    (Ballard,	    2000).	    The	    Last	    Planner	   System™	   emphasises	   the	   need	   to	   take	   into	   consideration	   information	   and	   resource	   constraints	   while	   preparing	   detailed	   near	   term	   and	   short-­‐term	   plans.	   Also,	   as	   the	   name	    suggests,	    the	    Last	    Planner	    System™	    emphasises	    the	    involvement	    of	    the	   construction	    teams	    including	    foremen,	    site	    supervisors	    and	    project	    manager(s)	   while	   planning	   in	   a	   collaborative	   way.	   The	   Last	   Planner	   System™	   along	   with	   other	   lean	    construction	    tools	    rest	    their	    foundation	    on	    the	    TFV	    (Transformation,	    Flow	   and	   Value)	   theory	   of	   production	   developed	   by	   Koskela	   (2000).	   In	   TFV,	   there	   is	   a	   greater	   emphasis	   on	   managing	   the	   flow	   aspect	   of	   production	   while	   taking	   care	   of	   the	    actual	    transformation	    process,	    which	    should	    ultimately	    lead	    to	    value	   generation	   for	   the	   client.	   The	   Last	   Planner	   System™	   takes	   care	   of	   the	   flow	   aspect	   by	   the	   process	   of	   constraints	   analysis,	   where	   individual	   constraints	   are	   analysed	   and	    managed	    for	    each	    task.	    This	    detailed	    planning	    workflow	    demands	    accurate	   and	    timely	    information,	    especially	    from	    constraints	    (resource)	    management	   perspective.	   1.2	   Justification	   for	   Research	   and	   the	   Research	   Problem	   This	    research	    aims	    to	    solve	    a	    problem	    that	    is	    practically	    relevant	    and	    also	    has	   potential	    for	    theoretical	    contribution,	    that	    of	    inefficient	    production	    management	   systems	    in	    construction.	    The	    research	    is	    relevant	    in	    the	    real	    world	    and	    makes	   contributions	   to	   the	   production	   management	   theory	   in	   construction.	    	   As	   discussed	   above,	   lean	   construction	   has	   been	   identified	   as	   one	   of	   the	   potential	   process	    improvement	    techniques	    to	    overcome	    the	    challenges	    faced	    by	    the	   construction	    industry.	    However,	    as	    noted	    above,	    the	    performance	    of	    the	   construction	    industry	    has	    not	    improved	    a	    great	    deal	    even	    after	    the	   recommendation	   of	   lean	   construction	   techniques.	   This	   view	   is	   also	   supported	   by	   a	   number	   of	   studies	   that	   have	   been	   carried	   out	   to	   identify	   barriers	   to	   the	   effective	   implementation	   of	   lean	   construction	   in	   the	   industry,	   which	    have	   highlighted	   the	   use	   of	   inappropriate	   tools	   as	   one	   key	   factor	   (Johansen	   et	   al.,	   2002,	   Bashir	   et	   al.,	   2010,	   Sarhan	   and	   Fox,	   2012).	   Furthermore,	   Sarhan	   and	   Fox	   (2012)	   identified	   “Lack	   of	   Process	   Based	   Project	   Management	   Systems”	   as	   one	   of	   the	   significant	   barriers	   to	   the	   successful	   implementation	   of	   Lean	   Construction	   in	   the	   UK.	   Hence	   it	   emerges	   that	   while	   lean	   production	   management	   is	   one	   of	   the	   recommended	   approaches	   to	   improve	    the	    efficiency	    of	    the	    construction	    process,	    the	    tools	    and	    systems	    that	   support	   it	   are	   not	   yet	   fully	   developed.	   The	   importance	   of	   information	   management	   from	   lean	   construction	   perspective,	   with	    greater	    emphasis	    on	    managing	    flow	    has	    also	    been	    highlighted	    by	    several	   authors	   (Sacks	   et	   al.,	   2010a;	   Sriprasert	   and	   Dawood,	   2003;	   Navon	   and	   Sacks,	   2007;	   Dave	   et	   al.,	   2010).	   Chua	   et	   al.	   (2003)	   emphasise	   the	   role	   of	   information	   technology	   in	    planning,	    especially	    from	    constraints	    management	    perspective,	    however	    they	   conclude	   that	   the	   current	   information	   management	   systems	   do	   not	   offer	   effective	   solutions.	    During	    a	    survey	    of	    a	    large-­‐scale	    project	    management	    information	    and	   control	    system,	    Futcher	    (2001)	    highlighted	    the	    need	    for	    the	    data	    entry	    at	    the	   project	    level	    as	    one	    of	    the	    most	    significant	    obstacles	    to	    the	    successful	   implementation.	   Similarly	   Koskela	   and	   Kazi	   (2003)	   have	   brought	   to	   attention	   the	   ineffectiveness	    of	    construction	    information	    systems	    as	    they	    do	    not	    support	    the	   core	   production	   processes,	   and	   in	   many	   cases	   prove	   to	   be	   counterproductive.	    	   From	   a	   theoretical	   perspective,	   the	   effects	   of	   TFV	   on	   production	   management	   in	   construction	   have	   been	   very	   well	   explored	   (Koskela	   2000),	   however	   its	   effects	   on	   enabling	   systems	   such	   as	   information	   management	   are	   not	   yet	   tackled	   (Dave	   et	   al.,	   2008).	   Analysis	   of	   the	   effects	   of	   TFV	   theory	   in	   information	   management	   systems	   could	    help	    identify	    and	    potentially	    resolve	    the	    problem	    of	    its	    ineffectiveness	    in	   production	   management.	   Thus,	    there	    is	    a	    two-­‐fold	    research	    problem	    that	    is	    being	    addressed.	    Firstly,	    the	   problem	    with	    the	    production	    management	    process	    is	    considered,	    and	   subsequently	    the	    problem	    with	    the	    inefficient	    information	    management	    systems	   that	   support	   the	   production	   management	   process	   is	   addressed.	   1.3	   Research	   aim	   and	   objectives	   Research	   Aim:	   This	   research	   aims	   at	   improved	   construction	   management	   through	   lean	    construction	    principles	    and	    building	    information	    modelling.	    To	    realise	    this	   aim	   the	   following	   research	   objectives	   have	   been	   identified.	   Research	   Objectives:	   1. To	    identify	    and	    analyse	    the	    main	    deficiencies	    within	    the	    current	   construction	   management	   process	   2. To	    explore	    the	    solution	    area	    and	    develop	    a	    conceptual	    framework	    of	   processes	   and	   tools	   for	   a	   production	   management	   and	   control	   system	   for	   construction	   3. To	   design	   and	   develop	   a	   prototype	   of	   a	   computer	   based	   system	   based	   on	   the	   above	   framework.	   4. To	   evaluate	   the	   solution	   and	   analyse/synthesise	   the	   results	   1.4	   Research	   method	   The	    type	    of	    method(s)	    used	    in	    research	    depends	    on	    the	    type	    and	    nature	    of	   research	   being	   conducted.	   In	   this	   case	   the	   research	   being	   carried	   out	   falls	   within	   the	   disciplines	   of	   information	   science	   and	   construction	   management	   as	   the	   aim	   is	   to	    develop	    a	    computer	    based	    system	    to	    support	    production	    management	    in	   construction.	   Lukka	    (2003)	    describes	    the	    constructive	    research	    approach	    as	    a	    research	   procedure	    for	    producing	    innovative	    constructions,	    intended	    to	    solve	    problems	   faced	   in	   the	   real	   world	   and,	   by	   that	   means,	   to	   make	   a	   contribution	   to	   the	   theory	   of	   the	   discipline	   in	   which	   it	   is	   applied.	   It	   is	   suggested	   that	   all	   human	   artefacts	   such	   as	   models,	    diagrams,	    plans,	    and	    information	    systems	    and	    their	    designs	    are	   constructions.	    The	    core	    features	    of	    the	    constructive	    research	    approach	    require	   that	   it	   (Lukka,	   2003):	   • Focuses	   on	   real-­‐world	   problems	   felt	   relevant	   to	   be	   solved	   in	   practice	   • Produces	   an	   innovative	   construction	   meant	   to	   solve	   the	   initial	   real-­‐world	   problem	   • Includes	    an	    attempt	    for	    implementing	    the	    developed	    construction	    and	   thereby	   a	   test	   for	   its	   practical	   applicability	   • Implies	   a	   very	   close	   involvement	   and	   co-­‐operation	   between	   the	   researcher	   and	   practitioners	   in	   a	   team-­‐like	   manner	   • Is	   explicitly	   linked	   to	   prior	   theoretical	   knowledge,	   and	   • Pays	   particular	   attention	   to	   reflecting	   the	   empirical	   findings	   back	   the	   theory	   A	   detailed	   methodology	   Chapter	   (Chapter	   2)	   discusses	   the	   methodology	   used	   and	   the	   justification	   behind	   it	   in	   more	   detail.	   It	   also	   explains	   in	   detail	   the	   steps	   taken	   to	   develop	    and	    evaluate	    the	    solution.	    Here,	    it	    should	    be	    noted	    that	    both	    design	   science	    and	    constructive	    research	    approaches	    are	    similar	    in	    nature	    and	    both	   provide	    guidelines	    outlining	    steps	    to	    be	    followed	    while	    designing	    a	    solution.	   Chapter	    2	    covers	    both,	    Design	    Science	    (Hevner	    et	    al.,	    2004)	    and	    Constructive	   Research	   (Lukka,	   2003)	   approaches	   and	   puts	   forward	   a	   set	   of	   guidelines	   (research	   framework)	   that	   were	   developed	   specifically	   for	   this	   research.	   1.5	   Scope	   This	   research	   is	   limited	   to	   the	   production	   management	   and	   control	   on	   site	   on	   a	   construction	   project.	   Specifically	   the	   planning	   scheduling	   workflow	   to	   support	   the	   Last	    Planner	    System™	    is	    targeted.	    The	    research	    aims	    to	    develop	    an	    information	   system	    to	    improve	    the	    production	    management	    process,	    however,	    the	    actual	   programming	   and	   database	   development	   are	   not	   within	   the	   scope	   of	   this	   research,	   but	    taken	    care	    of	    by	    a	    fellow	    researcher.	    Particular	    limitations	    related	    to	    this	   aspect	   are	   described	   in	   relevant	   Chapters	   in	   detail.	   Also,	    the	    research	    takes	    into	    consideration	    the	    product	    and	    process	    integration	   aspect	    while	    designing	    a	    solution.	    Here	    it	    is	    assumed	    that	    a	    product	    model	   (Building	    Information	    Model)	    already	    exists	    and	    is	    made	    available	    to	    the	   production	    team.	    The	    research	    does	    not	    make	    any	    suggestions	    or	   recommendations	   regarding	   the	   design	   practice.	   However,	    it	    should	    be	    noted	    that	    the	    domain	    of	    production	    management	    and	   control	   also	   encompasses	   design	   aspects	   (i.e.	   design	   can	   be	   treated	   as	   a	   part	   of	   the	   production	    system,	    and	    also	    that	    design	    tasks	    have	    to	    be	    managed	    just	    like	   construction	   tasks),	   and	   thus	   potential	   solutions	   in	   the	   form	   of	   Lean	   and	   BIM	   can	   be	    applicable	    to	    the	    whole	    process	    of	    design	    and	    construction	    (and	    operations).	   From	   this	   perspective,	   exploration	   of	   design	   management	   workflow,	   i.e.	   managing	   design	    production	    (planning	    and	    controlling	    of	    design	    tasks	    using	    the	    Last	   Planner™	    process)	    emerges	    as	    one	    of	    the	    possible	    areas	    that	    the	    research	    can	   address.	   Nevertheless,	   due	   to	   the	   limitation	   of	   time	   and	   resources	   it	   is	   not	   possible	   to	   explore	   all	   these	   areas	   within	   one	   doctoral	   thesis.	   Due	   to	   the	   background	   of	   the	   research	   candidate	   and	   the	   problem	   area	   being	   tackled,	   the	   research	   only	   focuses	   on	    the	    construction	    management	    aspects	    of	    the	    production	    process,	   predominantly	    on	    site	    based	    processes	    (in	    alignment	    to	    the	    use	    of	    the	    Last	   Planner™	   process	   to	   site	   based	   construction).	   Finally,	   as	   the	   research	   mostly	   took	   place	   in	   the	   UK,	   the	   construction	   processes	   and	   other	    choices	    related	    to	    the	    geographical	    context	    were	    related	    to	    this	    region.	   However,	    during	    the	    initial	    design	    (requirements	    capture)	    and	    then	    at	    the	   evaluations	   stage,	   several	   overseas	   organisations	   provided	   their	   feedback,	   most	   of	   them	   belonging	   to	   the	   lean	   community.	   1.6	   Contents	   The	    remaining	    part	    of	    this	    document	    is	    divided	    in	    six	    Chapters.	    The	    second	   Chapter	   describes	   the	   research	   methodology	   selected	   and	   the	   justification	   behind	   its	   selection.	   It	   also	   outlines	   the	   specific	   research	   method	   that	   was	   followed	   while	   designing	   a	   solution.	   The	    third	    Chapter	    begins	    by	    exploring	    the	    problem	    area	    of	    production	   management	   and	   information	   systems	   in	   construction	   through	   observations	   from	   industrial	    practice.	    These	    observations	    are	    from	    researcher’s	    own	    experience	   while	    working	    with	    these	    organisations.	    Subsequently,	    the	    Chapter	    explores	    the	   problems	    with	    the	    production	    management	    and	    information	    systems	    from	   literature	   review.	    	   The	    fourth	    Chapter	    explores	    the	    solution	    area	    in	    depth.	    Here	    the	    solution	    area	   being	    Lean	    Construction	    and	    Building	    Information	    Modelling.	    This	    Chapter	    is	   divided	    in	    two	    main	    parts,	    first	    the	    theoretical	    foundations	    of	    lean	    and	    BIM	    are	   studied,	    and	    secondly	    the	    prior	    research	    in	    addressing	    the	    area	    of	    production	   management	   with	   lean	   and	   BIM	   are	   explained.	    	   The	    fifth	    Chapter	    is	    also	    divided	    in	    two	    main	    parts;	    the	    first	    part	    discusses	    the	   design	   of	   the	   solution,	   which	   is	   called	   VisiLean,	   while	   the	   second	   part	   details	   the	   development	   process	   and	   the	   iterations	   of	   the	   prototype.	   This	   is	   followed	   by	   the	   evaluation	    of	    the	    prototype	    through	    demonstrations,	    discussions	    and	    a	    pilot	   project,	   and	   analysis	   of	   the	   evaluations	   in	   the	   sixth	   Chapter.	   Finally,	   the	   conclusion	   and	   discussion	   Chapter	   provides	   a	   synthesis	   of	   the	   research,	   main	   conclusions,	   contributions	   to	   theory	   and	   areas	   of	   future	   research.	   
2	   Research	   Methodology	   It	   is	   important	   to	   select	   an	   appropriate	   research	   method	   suitable	   for	   the	   problem	   at	   hand.	   As	   mentioned	   in	   previous	   chapter,	   the	   research	   problem	   falls	   within	   the	   realm	   of	   production	   management	   in	   construction	   and	   Information	   Science,	   and	   is	   practice	    oriented	    in	    nature.	    Design	    Science	    is	    fundamentally	    a	    problem	    solving	   paradigm	   (Hevner,	   2004),	   which	   has	   its	   roots	   in	   engineering	   and	   the	   science	   of	   the	   artificial	   (Simon,	   1996).	   It	   is	   suggested	   by	   Lukka	   (2003)	   that	   all	   human	   artefacts	   such	    as	    models,	    diagrams,	    plans,	    and	    information	    system	    designs	    are	   constructions.	    Design	    Science	    is	    increasingly	    being	    applied	    in	    the	    realm	    of	   information	   science	   research,	   but	   it	   is	   also	   being	   applied	   to	   other	   sectors	   including	   construction	    management	    (Tezel,	    2011;	    Rooke,	    2012).	    The	    core	    features	    of	    the	   constructive	   research	   approach	   require	   that	   it	   (Lukka,	   2003):	   • Focuses	   on	   real-­‐world	   problems	   felt	   relevant	   to	   be	   solved	   in	   practice	   • Produces	   an	   innovative	   construction	   meant	   to	   solve	   the	   initial	   real-­‐world	   problem	   • Includes	    an	    attempt	    for	    implementing	    the	    developed	    construction	    and	   thereby	   a	   test	   for	   its	   practical	   applicability	   • Implies	   a	   very	   close	   involvement	   and	   co-­‐operation	   between	   the	   researcher	   and	   practitioners	   in	   a	   team-­‐like	   manner	   • Is	   explicitly	   linked	   to	   prior	   theoretical	   knowledge	   • Pays	    particular	    attention	    to	    reflecting	    the	    empirical	    findings	    back	    the	   theory.	   This	   chapter	   provides	   details	   on	   the	   selected	   research	   method,	   starting	   with	   need	   and	    justification	    followed	    by	    a	    comparison	    between	    Design	    Science	    and	   Constructive	   Research.	   Following	   this,	   a	   comparison	   between	   Design	   Science	   and	   Natural	    Science,	    and	    place	    of	    Constructivism	    in	    Information	    Science	    is	    provided.	   This	    is	    followed	    by	    research	    process	    followed	    by	    VisiLean	    including	    the	   overarching	   research	   framework,	   research	   output	   and	   evaluation.	    	   2.1	   Need	   and	   justification	   for	   Constructive	   Research	   Both	    Constructive	    and	    Design	    Science	    research	    deals	    with	    “real	    world”	    practical	   problems	   as	   well	   as	   considering	   its	   theoretical	   contributions;	   it	   links	   the	   research	   and	   academic	   world	   with	   the	   industrial	   issues	   (Lukka,	   2003;	   Hevner,	   2004).	   Hence,	   the	    relevance	    of	    topic	    (in	    other	    words	    quality	    of	    research	    problem)	    improves	   significantly	    when	    using	    constructive	    research	    methodology	    in	    certain	    research	   fields.	    	   In	   research	   areas	   dealing	   with	   practical	   problems	   or	   issues	   that	   are	   close	   to	   the	   industry,	    using	    other	    research	    methods	    exclusively	    (i.e.	    surveys,	    observation,	   interviews)	    leads	    to	    unsatisfactory	    and	    low	    results.	    This	    is	    due	    to	    increasing	   frustration	   of	   organisations	   being	   asked	   to	   participate	   in	   surveys	   or	   interviews,	   as	   they	   feel	   that	   they	   don’t	   get	   much	   in	   return	   for	   their	   effort	   (Lukka,	   2003).	   Instead,	   in	    constructive	    research,	    emphasis	    is	    on	    two-­‐way	    communication	    as	    the	   researcher	   works	   very	   closely	   with	   organisations	   imparting	   valuable	   knowledge	   in	   the	   process.	   Lukka	   (2003)	   also	   mentions	   that	   to	   validate	   the	   research,	   and	   identify	   whether	   a	   certain	   solution/hypothesis/framework	   really	   works,	   is	   to	   actually	   test	   the	   idea	   in	   the	   field	   with	   practitioners.	   It	   is	   extremely	   difficult	   to	   validate	   such	   research	   just	   by	    asking	    questions	    or	    distributing	    questionnaires	    or	    collecting	    data	    through	   surveys.	   The	   constructive	   approach	   advocates	   the	   practice	   of	   testing	   the	   “truth”	   by	   finding	    out	    what	    works	    in	    practice	    through	    direct	    intervention	    of	    the	   researcher(s).	   Figure	   3	   illustrates	   the	   key	   elements	   of	   the	   constructive	   research	   approach	   (Lukka,	   2003).	    Figure	   3.	   Elements	   of	   constructive	   research	   (Lukka,	   2003).	   Research	    scholars	    in	    management	    and	    information	    science	    argue	    that	    whilst	   rigorous	    research	    is	    paramount	    to	    create	    new	    knowledge,	    it	    should	    also	    deliver	   application	   and	   relevant	   results	   for	   practical	   use	   (Holmström	   et	   al.,	   2009;	   van	   Aken	   2004).	   This	   demand	   has	   earlier	   been	   satisfied	   through	   the	   development	   of	   action	   research	    approach,	    and	    later	    through	    the	    use	    of	    constructive	    research	    approach	   and	    Design	    Science	    research	    approach	    (Piirainen	    and	    Gonzalez,	    2013).	    Both,	   Constructive	   Research	   Approach	   and	   Design	   Science	   aim	   to	   increase	   the	   relevance	   of	   management	   and	   information	   science	   research	   by	   putting	   the	   theory	   to	   practice	   through	   designing	   and/or	   constructing	   “constructions”	   (Kasanen	   et	   al.,	   1993).	   According	    to	    Hevner	    et	    al.	    (2004),	    two	    paradigms	    characterise	    majority	    of	    the	   research	   in	   Information	   Systems,	   that	   of	   behavioural	   science	   and	   design	   science.	   Whereas	   the	   behaviour	   science	   view	   develops	   or	   verifies	   theories	   that	   explain	   or	   predict	   human	   or	   organisational	   behaviour,	   design	   science	   paradigm	   extends	   the	   human/organisational	    boundaries	    of	    understanding	    by	    creating	    new	    and	   innovative	    artefacts.	    In	    information	    science	    the	    importance	    of	    design	    is	   emphasised	    and	    researchers	    have	    argued	    that	    the	    realm	    of	    information	    science	   research	   is	   directly	   related	   to	   design	   (Glass,	   1999;	   Winograd,	   1997).	    	   Hevner	    (2004)	    explains	    that	    unlike	    behaviour	    science	    research,	    which	    seeks	    to	   predict	    or	    explain	    phenomena	    that	    occur	    with	    respect	    to	    artefact’s	    use,	    design	   science	   creates	   and	   evaluates	   Information	   Technology	   artefacts	   intended	   to	   solve	   identified	   organisational	   problems.	    	   Hevner	   et	   al.	   (2004)	   also	   define	   a	   design	   process	   as	   a	   “sequence	   of	   expert	   activities	   that	    produces	    an	    innovative	    product	    (i.e.	    the	    design	    artefact).	    The	    authors	    also	   explain	   the	   dichotomy	   of	   design	   science	   paradigm,	   as	   design	   is	   considered	   both	   as	   a	   process	   and	   a	   product.	   The	   process	   is	   explained	   as	   a	   sequence	   of	   expert	   activities	   through	    which	    an	    innovative	    product	    (i.e.	    the	    design	    artefact)	    is	    produced.	   Subsequently,	   the	   evaluation	   of	   the	   artefact	   provides	   a	   better	   understanding	   of	   the	   problem	   (and	   a	   solution)	   in	   order	   to	   improve	   the	   quality	   of	   both	   the	   design	   process	   and	    the	    designed	    artefact.	    This	    activity	    of	    building	    an	    artefact	    and	    evaluation	    is	   carried	   out	   in	   a	   loop	   a	   number	   of	   times	   before	   the	   final	   artefact	   is	   generated.	   From	   the	   perspective	   of	   this	   research,	   this	   particular	   aspect	   of	   having	   an	   iteration	   cycle	   between	    artefact	    design	    and	    evaluation	    can	    be	    considered	    significant	    and	    has	    a	   potential	   to	   play	   a	   central	   role	   in	   the	   research.	    	   Hevner	   et	   al.	   (2004)	   provide	   a	   framework	   for	   Information	   Science	   research	   based	   on	   the	   design	   science	   method.	   Table	   1	   (Research	   Process	   followed	   for	   VisiLean)	   is	   based	    on	    this	    framework	    and	    explains	    each	    step	    taken	    in	    the	    research	    in	    the	   context	   of	   this	   framework.	   2.2	   Comparing	   Design	   Science	   with	   other	   approaches	   It	   is	   important	   to	   understand	   the	   position	   of	   Design	   Science	   with	   other	   research	   methods.	   Also,	   as	   Constructive	   Research	   and	   Design	   Science	   research	   are	   arguably	   similar,	   it	   is	   important	   to	   understand	   the	   key	   differences	   and	   converging	   aspects	   of	   these	    two	    methods.	    This	    section	    begins	    with	    comparing	    design	    science	    with	   constructive	    research	    and	    then	    compares	    design	    science	    with	    natural	    sciences.	   Finally,	   it	   describes	   the	   position	   of	   constructivism	   in	   Information	   Science	   research	   to	   provide	   clarity	   on	   the	   selection	   of	   research	   method.	   2.2.1	   Convergence	   of	   design	   science	   and	   constructive	   research	   In	   the	   literature,	   two	   approaches	   are	   found,	   which	   are	   argued	   to	   refer	   to	   a	   type	   of	   research	    that	    emphasizes	    the	    creation	    of	    something	    new	    into	    the	    world:	   constructive	   research	   and	   design	   science	   research.	   The	   question	   of	   the	   relation	   of	   these	    approaches	    arises.	    Piirainen	    and	    Gonzalez	    (2013)	    provide	    a	    detailed	    and	   critical	    comparison	    between	    Design	    Science	    and	    Constructive	    Research	   approaches.	   The	   authors	   state	   that	   from	   a	   definition	   perspective,	   one	   of	   the	   main	   differences	    is	    that	    when	    Design	    Science	    literature	    puts	    more	    weight	    in	    applying	   previous	   knowledge	   through	   a	   specific	   theory	   in	   the	   design,	   Constructive	   Research	   proposes	   a	   softer	   or	   creative	   approach	   (however,	   Constructive	   Research	   does	   not	   reject	   the	   use	   of	   a	   theory	   based	   approach).	   Piirainen	   and	   Gonzalez	   (2013)	   provide	   a	    further	    explanation	    through	    simplification	    of	    the	    general	    definition	    of	    Design	   Science	   research.	   In	   Design	   science,	   the	   basic	   logic	   of	   discovery	   is	   of	   a	   deductive	   nature,	    where	    a	    researcher	    applies	    a	    kernel	    theory	    to	    a	    previously	    unsolved	   problem	    (in	    order	    to	    solve	    it).	    By	    following	    this	    method,	    the	    theory	    provides	   general	    principles	    that	    can	    be	    applied	    to	    the	    specific	    problem	    and,	    in	    doing	    so,	   contributes	   to	   the	   theory	   by	   providing	   solutions	   based	   on	   it,	   or	   by	   extending	   the	   problem	    domain	    and	    generalisability	    of	    design	    principles.	    Whereas,	    in	   Constructive	    Research,	    the	    solution	    is	    based	    on	    deep	    knowledge	    of	    the	    problem	   and	   application	   of	   existing	   theory	   through	   a	   heuristic	   process.	    	   On	   the	   outset,	   there	   are	   many	   similarities	   between	   the	   two	   approaches,	   with	   only	   slight	   differences	   in	   terminology.	   For	   example,	   where	   Constructive	   Research	   uses	   the	   word	   “construction”	   Design	   Science	   uses	   the	   word	   “artefact”,	   but	   the	   definition	   and	    use	    of	    these	    terms	    in	    both	    approaches	    are	    quite	    similar.	    From	    process	   perspective	   too,	   both	   approaches	   have	   similarities.	   For	   example,	   both	   processes	   go	   from	    developing	    problem	    awareness	    and	    definition	    to	    solution	    proposition,	   artefact	    development	    and	    evaluation.	    In	    terms	    of	    application	    context,	    Design	   Science	    method	    seems	    to	    be	    applied	    predominantly	    in	    Information	    Science	   disciplines,	   but	   also	   some	   examples	   in	   Knowledge	   Management	   and	   management	   science	    exist	    (Markus	    et	    al.,	    2002;	    Osterwalder,	    2004,	    Wu,	    2009),	    whereas	   Constructive	   Research	   has	   a	   more	   generic	   approach	   and	   is	   being	   applied	   to	   both	   Information	   Science	   and	   general	   management	   applications	   (Kasanen	   et	   al.,	   1993;	   Hilmola,	   2007).	   In	   summary,	   it	   emerges	   that	   there	   are	   more	   similarities	   between	   these	   approaches	   than	    there	    are	    differences,	    and	    it	    is	    possible	    to	    frame	    the	    research	    within	    the	   framework	    of	    either	    of	    these	    approaches	    while	    taking	    guidance	    from	    both	   simultaneously.	    	   2.2.2	   Comparison	   of	   Constructive	   Research	   with	   Natural	   Science	   March	    and	    Smith	    (1995)	    compare	    natural	    science	    research	    with	    information	   science	   research	   (study	   of	   the	   artificial),	   where	   natural	   science	   includes	   research	   in	    physical,	    biological,	    social	    and	    behavioural	    domains,	    information	    science	    (or	   technology)	    research	    deals	    with	    human	    creations	    such	    as	    organisational	    and	   information	   systems.	   According	   to	   the	   authors,	   natural	   scientists	   develop	   sets	   of	   concepts	   or	   specialised	   language	   with	   which	   they	   characterise	   phenomena.	   These	   concepts	    are	    then	    used	    in	    higher	    order	    constructions	    such	    as	    laws,	    models	    and	   theories,	   which	   make	   claims	   about	   the	   nature	   of	   reality.	   On	   the	   other	   hand,	   design	   scientists	   work	   towards	   creating	   models,	   methods	   and	   implementations,	   which	   are	   innovative	   and	   valuable.	   March	   and	   Smith	   (1995)	   go	   further	   in	   differentiating	   natural	   science	   with	   design	   science.	   The	   authors	   mention	   that	   although	   design	   science	   produces	   artefacts	   and	   artificial	    phenomena,	    natural	    science	    can	    address	    both	    natural	    and	    artificial	   phenomena.	   As	   an	   example,	   natural	   scientists	   can	   try	   to	   understand	   organisational	   processes	    or	    implications	    of	    an	    information	    system	    implementation	    on	   collaboration	   between	   employees.	   Hence	   the	   distinction	   is	   not	   made	   on	   the	   topic	   being	    studied	    alone,	    but	    is	    based	    on	    the	    research	    objectives.	    Whereas	    natural	   science	   aims	   to	   understand	   phenomena,	   design	   science	   aims	   at	   developing	   ways	   to	   achieve	   human	   goals.	   Once	   constructed,	   design	   science	   artefacts	   could	   become	   the	   subject	    of	    natural	    science	    research,	    for	    example	    by	    studying	    their	    effect	    on	   behaviour	   of	   employees	   within	   an	   organisation.	    	   Hevner	   et	   al.	   (2004)	   shed	   further	   light	   on	   the	   subject	   of	   positioning	   design	   science	   against	    natural	    science.	    The	    authors	    claim	    that	    whereas	    in	    natural	    science,	    the	   underlying	   assumption	   is	   that	   somewhere	   some	   “truth”	   exists	   and	   somehow	   it	   can	   be	    extracted,	    explicated	    and	    codified.	    Hence,	    the	    behaviour	    or	    natural	    science	   paradigm	   seeks	   to	   find	   “what	   is	   true”,	   where	   on	   the	   other	   hand	   the	   design	   science	   paradigm	    seeks	    to	    create	    “what	    is	    effective”.	    The	    authors	    also	    go	    further	    and	   mention	    that	    the	    design	    science	    method	    is	    proactive	    while	    dealing	    with	   technology,	    as	    it	    strives	    to	    create	    innovative	    artefacts	    to	    solve	    practical	   information	    system	    related	    problems.	    On	    the	    other	    hand,	    the	    behaviour-­‐science	   research	   methods	   are	   reactive	   with	   respect	   to	   technology,	   as	   it	   takes	   it	   as	   a	   “given”	   and	   attempts	   to	   study	   and	   explain	   the	   acquisition,	   implementation,	   management	   and	   use	   of	   such	   technologies.	    	   In	   critical	   analysis,	   according	   to	   Hevner	   et	   al.	   (2004),	   the	   risk	   in	   design	   science	   is	   to	   create	   artefacts	   that	   although	   well	   designed,	   are	   not	   grounded	   in	   any	   theory	   and	   hence	   useless	   in	   practice.	   Similarly,	   the	   risk	   in	   behaviour-­‐science	   research	   is	   the	   overemphasis	    on	    theories	    and	    failure	    to	    take	    into	    account	    capabilities	    of	   innovative	   and	   state-­‐of-­‐the	   art	   technologies,	   resulting	   in	   development	   of	   theories	   or	   principles	   that	   address	   out-­‐dated	   technologies.	   2.2.3	    Position	    of	    Constructivism	    or	    Interpretive	    Philosophy	    in	    Information	    Science	   Research	   When	    providing	    a	    comparison	    between	    different	    approaches	    to	    Information	   Science	   Research	   and	   their	   relation	   with	   the	   Design	   Science	   approach,	   Hevner	   et	   al.	   (2004)	   and	   March	   and	   Smith	   (1995)	   position	   behavioural	   science	   as	   a	   branch	   of	   natural	   science.	    	    It	   is	   important	   to	   pinpoint	   that	   there	   is	   a	   branch	   of	   behavioural	   science	   that	   does	   not	   fall	   into	   natural	   science,	   namely	   the	   constructivist	   approach.	    	   For	   the	   sake	   of	   clarity,	   it	   is	   necessary	   to	   state	   that	   this	   constructivist	   approach	   is	   completely	    different	    from	    constructive/design	    science	    research,	    although	    it	    (as	   other	   approaches	   in	   behavioural	   science)	   can	   be	   used	   in	   a	   number	   of	   stages	   of	   a	   design	   science	   research	   cycle,	   especially	   in	   creating	   awareness	   of	   the	   problem	   and	   in	   evaluation.	   Mallon	   (2013)	   explains	   social	   constructionist	   claims	   as	   having	   the	   form	   of	   a	   two	   part	   relation:	   X	   socially	   constructs	   Y.	   Orlikowski	   and	   Baroudi	   (1991)	   describe	   that	   in	   interpretivism,	   reality	   and	   our	   own	   knowledge	   of	   reality	   are	   not	   independent	   of	   the	    social	    actors	    (i.e.	    us,	    humans	    and	    society	    in	    general),	    but	    are	    perceived	    as	    a	   social	    construction	    or	    interpretation.	    Hence,	    the	    world	    is	    not	    perceived	    as	   constituting	   of	   fixed	   objects,	   but	   rather	   as	   an	   “emergent	   social	   process,	   and	   as	   an	   extension	    of	    human	    consciousness	    and	    subjective	    experience”	    (Burrell	    and	   Morgan,	    1979).	    Hence,	    the	    aim	    of	    interpretivism	    or	    constructivism	    is	    to	   understand	   how	   social	   actors	   belonging	   to	   a	   particular	   group	   interpret	   their	   reality	   and	   associate	   it	   with	   meaning,	   and	   to	   demonstrate	   how	   these	   meanings,	   beliefs	   or	   intentions	   lead	   to	   form	   their	   social	   action	   (Orlikowski	   and	   Baroudi,	   1991).	    	   Within	   this	   context,	   the	   use	   of	   constructivism	   is	   especially	   useful	   when	   trying	   to	   explore	   underlying	   connections	   among	   different	   parts	   of	   social	   systems,	   such	   as	   a	   user	    group,	    organisations	    etc.	    For	    example,	    studies	    into	    how	    a	    particular	   technology	    is	    perceived	    by	    a	    group	    of	    users	    or	    how	    the	    adoption	    of	    a	    certain	   technology	    has	    occurred	    within	    a	    certain	    organisation	    are	    potential	    topics	    of	   research	   under	   the	   constructivism	   approach.	   2.3	   Process	   of	   constructive	   research	   March	   &	   Smith	   (1995)	   provide	   an	   elementary	   framework	   as	   shown	   in	   Figure	   4	   for	   conducting	    constructive	    research.	    This	    research	    matrix	    provides	    sixteen	    cells	   containing	   potential	   research	   efforts.	   The	   research	   could	   lie	   in	   one	   or	   more	   cells	   depending	   on	   the	   context,	   where	   each	   cell	   could	   have	   different	   objectives	   and	   use	   different	   methods	   to	   satisfy	   them.	   Research	   can	   build,	   evaluate,	   theorise	   or	   justify	   theories	   about	   constructs,	   models,	   methods	   or	   instantiations.	    	   Research Activities 	   Build Evaluate Theorize Justify Constructs     Model     Method     Instantiation     Research Outputs Figure	   4.

Steps	   taken	   in	   design	   science	   research	   (Lukka,	   2003).	   Lukka	   (2003)	   provides	   a	   set	   of	   steps	   as	   shown	   in	   Figure	   5	   to	   characterise	   typical	   research	    process	    followed	    by	    constructive	    research.	    These	    steps	    are	    described	   based	   on	   Lukka	   (2003).	   2.3.1	    Find	    a	    practically	    relevant	    problem,	    which	    also	    has	    potential	    for	    theoretical	   contribution.	    	   In	   most	   cases	   the	   problem	   is	   selected	   through	   researcher’s	   personal	   experience	   in	   the	    field,	    i.e.	    it	    is	    observed/experienced	    first-­‐hand.	    Additionally,	    discussing	    with	   practitioners	    and	    experts	    is	    another	    approach	    to	    identify	    practical	    problems.	    If	   identifying	    a	    problem	    through	    literature	    search	    or	    other	    means,	    a	    close	   observation	   of	   the	   problems	   faced	   by	   the	   industry	   through	   industry	   journals	   and	   other	    such	    means	    can	    also	    be	    quite	    useful.	    Essentially,	    the	    problem	    area	    should	   have	   both	   –	   practical	   and	   theoretical	   concerns.	    	   2.3.2	    Examine	    the	    potential	    for	    long-­‐term	    research	    cooperation	    with	    the	    target	   organisation.	    	   As	    constructive	    research	    deals	    with	    a	    practical	    problem,	    it	    is	    essential	    that	    the	   researcher(s)	   has	   access	   to	   a	   target	   organisation	   (or	   several	   if	   relevant)	   through	   the	   duration	   of	   the	   research.	   In	   majority	   of	   the	   cases	   input	   from	   both	   sides	   will	   be	   required	   at	   certain	   stages	   and	   this	   should	   be	   made	   explicit	   at	   the	   beginning	   of	   the	   research.	    Also,	    the	    credibility	    of	    the	    researcher	    and	    research	    topic	    and	   contribution	    made	    by	    it	    to	    the	    organisation	    should	    be	    established	    in	    the	    target	   organisation(s)	    to	    create	    trust.	    Not	    always	    necessary,	    but	    a	    formal	    research	   agreement	   outlining	   the	   research	   activities/schedule,	   key	   milestones,	   funding	   and	   access	   to	   information	   can	   be	   developed	   at	   the	   beginning	   of	   the	   project.	    	   2.3.3	   Obtain	   deep	   understanding	   of	   the	   topic	   area	   both	   theoretically	   and	   practically.	    	   In	    this	    step,	    the	    researcher	    starts	    by	    getting	    a	    better	    understanding	    the	   organisation’s	    practices	    using	    usual	    ethnographic	    methods	    such	    as	    direct	   observation,	   interviews	   and	   desk	   study	   in	   order	   to	   gain	   deep	   understanding	   of	   the	   problem	    area.	    Also,	    it	    is	    expected	    that	    the	    researcher	    should	    be	    well	    informed	   about	   the	   existing	   practices	   and	   theories	   prevailing	   in	   the	   problem	   domain	   so	   that	   towards	    the	    later	    part	    of	    the	    research	    he/she	    can	    analyse	    the	    outcome	    and	    its	   contribution	    to	    the	    existing	    theories	    and	    research	    domain.	    The	    overall	   achievement	   of	   this	   step	   is	   to	   outline	   the	   problem	   and	   existing	   situation	   in	   detail	   before	   setting	   out	   to	   find	   potential	   solution.	    	   2.3.4	   Innovate	   a	   solution	   idea	   and	   develop	   a	   problem	   solving	   construction,	   which	   also	   has	   potential	   for	   theoretical	   contribution.	    	   This	    is	    the	    one	    of	    the	    core	    parts	    of	    the	    research	    being	    conducted.	    Here,	    the	   researcher	   develops	   a	   conceptual	   solution	   to	   tackle	   a	   problem	   he/she	   identified	   in	   the	    first	    step,	    keeping	    in	    mind	    the	    surrounding	    issues	    identified	    in	    subsequent	   steps	   and	   also	   ensuring	   fit	   within	   target	   organisation(s).	   In	   this	   step	   the	   researcher	   identifies	    whether	    a	    solution	    can	    be	    developed	    in	    the	    first	    place,	    if	    not	    feasible,	   either	   the	   research	   is	   dropped	   or	   significantly	   changed.	   Also,	   as	   this	   phase	   is	   highly	   creative	    in	    nature	    it	    is	    difficult	    to	    follow	    a	    particular	    research	    method.	    Most	   solutions	   are	   developed	   in	   an	   iterative	   (trial	   and	   error)	   fashion	   and	   several	   loops	   of	   implementation	   and	   analysis	   are	   also	   carried	   out.	   The	   process	   of	   identifying	   the	   solution	   can	   also	   be	   quite	   valuable	   contribution	   to	   knowledge	   regardless	   of	   the	   end	   result.	   2.3.5	   Implement	   the	   solution	   and	   test	   how	   it	   works	   The	    solution	    developed	    in	    the	    previous	    step	    is	    now	    implemented	    in	    a	    practical	   environment	   in	   the	   chosen	   organisation.	   This	   is	   where	   the	   solution	   gets	   tested	   not	   only	   from	   the	   technical	   perspective	   but	   also	   from	   the	   process	   perspective,	   wherein	   the	    processes	    needed	    to	    run	    the	    solution	    are	    also	    tested.	    Throughout	    the	   implementation,	   the	   researcher	   has	   to	   actively	   take	   part	   in	   the	   process	   as	   he/she	   is	   the	   one	   who	   is	   most	   familiar	   with	   the	   concept.	   This	   step	   differentiates	   the	   design	   science	    research	    from	    traditional	    research	    methods	    where	    hardly	    any	    empirical	   evidence	    of	    the	    innovative	    construct	    is	    gathered,	    or	    the	    participation	    of	    the	   researcher	   in	   any	   such	   process	   is	   limited.	    	   2.3.6	   Ponder	   the	   scope	   of	   applicability	   of	   the	   solution	   This	   is	   the	   analysis	   step	   where	   the	   researcher	   along	   with	   the	   target	   organisations	   start	   analysing	   the	   outcome	   of	   the	   implementation	   carried	   out	   in	   the	   previous	   step.	   Regardless	    of	    the	    outcome	    (whether	    successful	    or	    not),	    there	    will	    be	    a	    scope	    to	   learn	   from	   the	   implementation	   process.	   If	   successful,	   the	   further	   diffusion	   of	   the	   solution	   in	   the	   wider	   industry	   should	   also	   be	   considered	   along	   with	   the	   process	   steps.	   This	   should	   also	   form	   the	   part	   of	   the	   contribution	   of	   knowledge.	    	   2.3.7	   Identify	   and	   analyse	   the	   theoretical	   foundation	   From	   a	   research	   and	   academic	   perspective,	   this	   is	   the	   most	   important	   part	   of	   the	   research.	   Here,	   the	   researcher	   analyses	   the	   findings	   and	   identifies	   the	   implications	   for	    the	    original	    theory(ies).	    Lukka	    (2003)	    identifies	    two	    distinct	    type	    of	   contributions	   to	   the	   theory,	   namely	   the	   novel	   construction	   itself	   and	   the	   positive	   relationships	    behind	    the	    construction.	    In	    the	    first	    instance,	    if	    the	    innovative	   solution	   is	   found	   to	   be	   successful,	   then	   that	   itself	   provides	   a	   contribution	   to	   the	   theory/prior	    literature.	    Secondly,	    the	    application	    of	    the	    existing	    theory/prior	   literature	   while	   construction	   the	   innovative	   solution,	   and	   its	   relationship	   with	   the	   solution	    and	    outcome	    is	    also	    of	    importance.	    Theory	    refinement	    is	    the	    most	   important	   part	   of	   the	   research	   project,	   where	   our	   prior	   beliefs	   on	   the	   means-­‐ends	   relationships	   are	   revaluated.	   2.4	   Research	   outputs	    	   Figure	    4	    demonstrated	    a	    research	    framework	    showing	    the	    relation	    between	   research	    outputs	    and	    research	    activities.	    The	    following	    describes	    the	    research	   outputs	   that	   were	   generated	   through	   the	   constructive	   research	   process	   in	   form	   of	   constructs,	    model,	    method	    and	    instantiation.	    Figure	    6	    shows	    the	    framework	    for	   research,	   which	   is	   based	   on	   the	   discussion	   above	   and	   the	   framework	   suggested	   in	   Figure	    4.	    It	    should	    be	    noted	    that	    while	    “Justification”	    is	    also	    a	    part	    of	    the	   constructive	   research	   framework	   as	   shown	   in	   Figure	   4,	   it	   is	   outside	   the	   scope	   of	   this	   research.	   The	   justification	   activity	   as	   explained	   by	   March	   and	   Smith	   (1995)	   is	   aimed	    to	    gather	    evidence	    to	    test	    the	    theory,	    which	    the	    research	    is	    building	    or	   contributing	    to.	    However,	    due	    to	    the	    limited	    time	    available	    to	    carry	    out	    the	   research,	   it	   has	   not	   been	   possible	   to	   gather	   evidence	   to	   test	   the	   theory.	   2.4.1	   Constructs	    	   Initially,	    the	    Lean	    and	    BIM	    conceptual	    framework	    (Sacks	    et	    al.,	    2010),	    which	    is	   described	   in	   detail	   in	   Chapter	   4,	   served	   as	   the	   overarching	   conceptual	   framework	   behind	    the	    research	    and	    provided	    a	    background	    to	    the	    research.	    This	    Lean	    and	   BIM	   framework	   was	   developed	   to	   identify	   the	   conceptual	   synergies	   between	   Lean	   Construction	    and	    Building	    Information	    Modelling	    where	    a	    matrix	    between	    main	   lean	   principles	   (16)	   and	   leading	   BIM	   functions	   (8)	   was	   developed.	   The	   framework	   and	    the	    overarching	    research	    identified	    significant	    synergies	    between	    these	    two	   areas.	   The	   author	   was	   one	   of	   the	   main	   contributors	   to	   this	   framework	   (as	   one	   of	   the	   co-­‐authors).	   2.4.2	   Model	   Subsequently,	   a	   system	   specification	   and	   functional	   requirement	   specification	   for	   a	   potential	   lean	   and	   BIM	   system	   as	   described	   will	   be	   developed.	   This	   will	   serve	   as	   the	    model	    and	    as	    described	    below,	    will	    populate	    both	    build	    and	    evaluate	    cells.	   VisiLean	    development	    itself	    will	    act	    as	    the	    evaluation	    part	    of	    the	    model	    and	   subsequently	    the	    model	    will	    be	    evaluated	    when	    VisiLean	    will	    be	    trialled	    on	    a	   construction	   project.	    	   2.4.3	   Method	   Once	   the	   model	   has	   been	   developed,	   a	   method	   of	   development	   and	   also	   a	   method	   of	   implementation	   will	   be	   chosen.	   The	   latter	   here	   is	   of	   much	   higher	   importance,	   as	   the	   method	   of	   implementation	   of	   such	   a	   system	   has	   the	   potential	   to	   guide	   future	   implementations	   of	   similar	   systems	   across	   the	   industry	   if	   evaluated,	   analysed	   and	   theorised	   correctly.	    	    	   2.4.4	   Instantiation	   Instantiation	   in	   form	   of	   VisiLean	   prototype	   will	   take	   place	   in	   the	   build	   phase.

A two-stage problem – first, the information systems supporting the lean production process are inefficient, secondly the systems supporting the product representation (building information model) do not integrate well with the project management systems (especially from lean management perspective). 2 Examine the potential for long-term research cooperation with target organisation(s) Industry partners including software development companies in the area of construction management and BIM and large construction organisations who are at the forefront of lean and BIM implementation collaborated during research. No formal agreements have been signed, however, the cooperation has been excellent and access to information and availability of resources to support the research has been continuous. Stage Description Corresponding features in research realisation 3 Obtain deep understanding of the topic area both practically and theoretically Several methods have been used. Literature review, case studies, interviews, site visits formed the initial part of this stage while building the research problem and understanding current situation. Secondly, through workshops, and interviews practical understanding of the problem was gained that subsequently led to the next step of designing the solution. 4 Innovate a solution idea and develop a problem solving construction, which also has potential for theoretical contribution Initially a conceptual framework and broad information system architecture based on the requirements capture during workshops was developed. Subsequently functional specifications and a prototype was developed and demonstrated through meetings and workshops. 5 Implement the solution and test how it works Workshops and site visits to demonstrate the prototype to target users have been carried out. Based on the feedback received the system has been modified to suit new requirements. A pilot project has also been carried out and feedback received. 6 Ponder the scope of applicability of the solution Initial feedback during the pilot implementation and demonstrations have been analysed. However, further analysis and wider applicability is outside the scope of this research. 7 Identify and analyse the theoretical contribution Essentially, the theoretical contribution will be to both – information systems within construction and the construction management theory (TFV). 2.6	   Evaluation	   of	   research	   March	   and	   Smith	   (1995)	   describe	   the	   evaluation	   process	   as	   “we	   evaluate	   artefacts	   to	   determine	   if	   we	   have	   made	   any	   progress.	   The	   main	   question	   is	   how	   well	   does	   the	   newly	   constructed	   artefact	   work?”	   Lukka	   (2003)	   mentions	   that	   this	   is	   the	   first	   practical	   test	   (“market	   test”)	   of	   the	   designed	   construction	   (artefact)	   and	   should	   be	   viewed	   as	   one	   of	   the	   key	   characteristics	   of	   the	   constructive	   approach,	   relying	   on	   the	   pragmatic	   notion	   of	   truth.	   Lukka	   (2003)	   also	   mentions	   the	   importance	   of	   the	   deep	   involvement	   of	   the	   researcher	   with	   the	   practical	   implementation	   itself,	   and	   that	    he/she	    (researcher)	    should	    actively	    sell	    the	    innovative	    idea	    to	    target	   organisations,	    consider	    training	    of	    key	    personnel	    and	    consider	    pilot	    tests	    to	   thoroughly	   evaluate	   the	   concept.	   Hevner	    et	    al.	    (2004)	    emphasise	    that	    the	    utility,	    quality	    and	    efficacy	    of	    a	    design	   artefact	   must	   be	   rigorously	   demonstrated	   via	   well-­‐executed	   evaluation	   methods.	   Evaluation	   according	   to	   Hevner	   et	   al.	   (2004)	   is	   a	   crucial	   component	   of	   the	   design	   science	    research	    process	    where	    the	    business	    environment	    establishes	    the	   requirements	    upon	    which	    the	    evaluation	    of	    the	    artefact	    should	    be	    based.	    The	   authors	    note	    that	    the	    environment	    includes	    the	    technical	    infrastructure	    which	   itself	   is	   incrementally	   built	   by	   the	   implementation	   of	   new	   information	   technology	   artefacts.	    Hence	    the	    process	    of	    integrating	    the	    artefact	    within	    the	    technical	   infrastructure	    of	    the	    business	    environment	    is	    itself	    part	    of	    the	    evaluation	    of	   process.	    	   Although	    the	    overarching	    research	    framework	    adopted	    is	    Design	   Science/Constructive	    Research,	    principles	    for	    qualitative	    research	    are	    used	    to	   collect	   feedback	   from	   the	   industry	   (both	   during	   problem	   analysis	   and	   evaluation	   stage).	   This	   is	   as	   feedback	   gathering	   through	   interviews	   and	   workshops	   fall	   within	   the	    realm	    of	    qualitative	    research.	    Hence,	    guiding	    principles	    from	    the	    qualitative	   research	    domain	    are	    applied	    in	    conducting	    interviews	    and	    selecting	    the	    sample	   size.	    	   According	   to	   Mason	   (2010),	   sample	   sizes	   in	   qualitative	   studies	   are	   normally	   much	   smaller	    than	    those	    in	    quantitative	    studies.	    Ritchie	    et	    al.	    (2003)	    have	    provided	    a	   number	   of	   reasons	   for	   this.	   One	   of	   the	   main	   reasons	   is	   that	   with	   qualitative	   studies,	   which	   use	   techniques	   such	   as	   interviews,	   larger	   sample	   size	   does	   not	   necessarily	   lead	   to	   more	   information	   (Guest	   et	   al.,	   2006).	   This	   is	   because	   a	   single	   occurrence	   of	   a	   code	   (a	   term	   used	   for	   a	   piece	   of	   information	   in	   qualitative	   research)	   is	   all	   that	   is	   needed	   to	   include	   it	   in	   the	   analysis	   framework.	   Whereas	   frequencies	   (number	   of	   occurrences	    of	    a	    code)	    are	    highly	    important	    in	    quantitative	    research,	    they	    are	   rarely	   important	   in	   qualitative	   research	   (Crouch	   and	   Mckenzie,	   2006).	   This	   is	   also	   because	   context	   and	   meaning	   have	   higher	   importance	   in	   qualitative	   research	   than	   making/confirming	   generalised	   hypothetical	   statements	   (Mason,	   2010).	   However,	    as	    it	    is	    possible	    to	    have	    a	    wide	    range	    of	    opinions	    from	    a	    set	    of	   participants,	   the	   qualitative	   research	   sample	   size	   should	   be	   large	   enough	   so	   that	   it	   covers	   the	   whole	   range	   of	   input.	   Although	   it	   is	   not	   possible	   to	   exactly	   determine	   the	    sample	    size	    before	    the	    study	    begins,	    it	    is	    possible	    to	    apply	    the	    principle	    of	   “saturation”.	   Saturation	   in	   qualitative	   studies	   can	   be	   defined	   as	   a	   point	   where	   the	   collection	   of	   new	   data	   does	   not	   shed	   any	   new	   light	   on	   the	   issue	   being	   investigated	   (Glaser	   and	   Strauss,	   1967).	   A	   relevant	   principle	   here	   is	   that	   of	   Consensus	   Theory,	   where	   Romney	   et	   al.	   (1986)	   propose	   that	   experts	   tend	   to	   agree	   more	   with	   each	   other	   (within	   the	   context	   area	   of	   their	   expertise)	   than	   novices.	   The	   authors	   provide	   a	   mathematical	   proof	   of	   their	   theory	   and	   confirm	   that	   small	   samples,	   for	   example	   as	   small	   as	   four	   individuals,	   can	   render	   extremely	   accurate	   information	   with	   a	   high	   confidence	   level	   (within	   the	   research	    domain).	    Although	    Consensus	    Theory	    was	    originally	    intended	    for	    and	   deals	   with	   knowledge	   instead	   of	   experiences	   and	   perception,	   it	   is	   still	   relevant	   to	   open	   ended	   questions,	   which	   deal	   with	   perception	   and	   beliefs.	   Further	    details	    of	    the	    evaluation	    process,	    methods	    followed	    and	    the	    results	   obtained	   through	   evaluation	   are	   described	   in	   Chapter	   5	   and	   6.	   2.7	   Summary	   of	   Research	   Methodology	   This	   research	   deals	   with	   two	   separate	   disciplines,	   namely	   production	   management	   and	   information	   science,	   where	   the	   aim	   is	   to	   develop	   an	   information	   system	   that	   solves	   a	   practical	   problem	   within	   the	   area	   of	   production	   management.	   Due	   to	   the	   nature	   of	   the	   problem	   and	   solution	   being	   developed,	   the	   research	   falls	   within	   the	   boundaries	    of	    design	    science.	    In	    this	    chapter,	    the	    benefits	    of	    applying	    Design	   Science	   method	   to	   practical	   and	   industry	   related	   problems	   are	   highlighted	   against	   other	    methods.	    Especially,	    as	    the	    Design	    Science	    method	    provides	    a	    flexible	    yet	   rigorous	   and	   structured	   method	   to	   develop	   a	   solution	   that	   is	   relevant	   to	   industry,	   it	   is	   found	   to	   be	   most	   appropriate	   for	   this	   research.	   It	   is	   also	   found	   that	   there	   are	   more	    similarities	    than	    differences	    between	    constructive	    research	    and	    Design	   Management,	    and	    for	    sake	    of	    simplicity,	    this	    research	    considers	    principles	    from	   both	   these	   initiatives.	   Compared	   to	   natural	   and	   behavioural	   science,	   which	   tend	   to	   deal	   with	   problems	   related	    to	    “seeking	    the	    truth”,	    Design	    Science	    deals	    with	    problems	    related	    to	   “seeking	   what	   is	   effective”.	   Constructivism	   or	   behaviour	   science	   also	   has	   its	   place	   in	    Information	    Science,	    especially	    in	    identifying	    organisational	    behaviour,	    user	   acceptance	   or	   effectiveness	   while	   implementing	   an	   information	   science	   solution.	   Hence,	    once	    an	    artefact	    (construct,	    theory,	    framework,	    etc.),	    has	    been	    created	   through	    Design	    Science,	    the	    subsequent	    stages	    of	    its	    implementation	    and	   evaluation	   in	   the	   organisation	   can	   be	   carried	   out	   using	   principles	   from	   behaviour	   science.	   Wherever	   possible,	   further	   details	   into	   the	   research	   method	   applied	   to	   a	   particular	   part	   of	   the	   research	   are	   provided,	   especially	   in	   the	   evaluation	   section.	    	   
3	   Problems	   with	   the	   Production	   Management	   Systems:	   Understanding	   the	   problem	   and	   the	   context	   3.1	   Problem	   Awareness:	   Observations	   from	   the	   industrial	   practice	   In	   design	   science,	   the	   researcher	   starts	   with	   a	   practical	   problem	   at	   hand,	   explores	   the	   problem	   area	   further	   to	   create	   detailed	   awareness	   and	   develops	   a	   solution	   to	   overcome	   that	   problem.	   This	   research	   also	   started	   with	   a	   very	   practical	   problem	   that	    the	    researcher	    had	    encountered	    while	    working	    within	    the	    construction	   industry.	    	   The	    following	    section	    discusses	    the	    problem	    and	    presents	    the	    context	    for	    the	   research	   and	   the	   solution	   developed.	   To	   preserve	   anonymity	   of	   the	   organisations	   presented,	    their	    details	    are	    not	    mentioned	    in	    the	    discussion.	    One	    company	    was	   based	    in	    India	    while	    the	    other	    was	    based	    in	    the	    UK.	    The	    author	    had	    the	   opportunity	   to	   make	   close	   observations	   over	   a	   period	   of	   time,	   which	   contributed	   to	   some	   of	   the	   early	   understanding	   of	   the	   problem	   as	   described	   below.	   3.1.1	   Observations	   from	   Company	   A	   The	    observations	    were	    made	    during	    the	    implementation	    of	    an	    internally	   developed	    Enterprise	    Resource	    Planning	    (ERP)	    system	    within	    a	    construction	   company.	    One	    of	    the	    core	    purposes	    of	    the	    new	    ERP	    system	    was	    to	    increase	   efficiency	    of	    individual	    functions	    that	    were	    being	    served,	    as	    well	    as	    providing	   integration	   between	   various	   departments	   located	   at	   separate	   geographic	   locations.	   Company	   A	   had	   developed	   the	   ERP	   system	   internally	   by	   hiring	   a	   team	   of	   Software	   Developers	   who	   were	   led	   by	   the	   IT	   manager	   and	   helped	   by	   the	   MIS	   (Management	   Information	   Systems)	   Manager.	    	   The	   implementation	   process	   had	   initially	   experienced	   problems,	   as	   the	   users	   of	   the	   system	   had	   not	   accepted	   the	   system	   in	   its	   current	   form	   due	   to	   problems	   with	   user	   interface,	    missing	    features	    and	    incorrect	    processes.	    After	    some	    initial	    analysis	    it	   emerged	   that	   the	   users	   had	   not	   been	   consulted	   in	   the	   first	   place	   when	   the	   system	   was	   being	   developed	   leading	   to	   subsequent	   problems.	    	   The	   Enterprise	   Resource	   Planning	   system	   consisted	   of	   the	   following	   modules:	   i. Procurement	   ii. Asset	   Management	   iii. Stores/inventory	   iv. Human	   resources	   v. Accounting	   vi. Payroll	   The	    following	    major	    observations	    regarding	    the	    ICT	    systems	    were	    made	    at	   Company	   A:	   • The	   information	   integration	   between	   various	   functions	   (which	   was	   the	   core	   parts	    of	    the	    system)	    had	    still	    not	    been	    achieved	    even	    after	    the	    full	   implementation.	   This	   resulted	   in	   duplication	   of	   data	   entry	   at	   several	   points.	   • One	   of	   the	   main	   observations	   made	   was	   that	   while	   the	   peripheral	   functions	   of	   this	   construction	   company	   were	   addressed	   with	   the	   ERP	   modules	   listed	   above,	    the	    very	    core	    of	    the	    business	    –	    the	    production	    (or	    construction)	   process	    itself	    remained	    unaffected.	    As	    a	    result	    each	    project	    manager	    was	   left	   to	   devise	   his	   or	   her	   own	   system.	   Many	   developed	   their	   own	   solutions	   based	    around	    manual	    paper	    based	    documents	    and	    Excel	    Spread	    sheets.	   However,	    these	    individually	    designed	    systems	    remained	    completely	   isolated	    from	    the	    ERP	    system	    and	    hence	    the	    information	    availability	    at	   production	    level	    was	    absent.	    As	    a	    result,	    traditional	    communication	   channels	   of	   telephones,	   faxes,	   and	   emails	   were	   utilised	   to	   obtain	   production	   related	   information.	   • When	   the	   candidate	   visited	   the	   organisation	   after	   9	   years,	   it	   was	   observed	   that	    even	    as	    the	    organisation	    had	    implemented	    new	    features	    such	    as	   electronic	   procurement	   and	   provided	   access	   to	   some	   construction	   projects	   to	    the	    ERP	    system,	    the	    actual	    production	    management	    process	    still	   remained	   unaffected	   and	   relied	   on	   individually	   devised	   systems.	   3.1.2	   Observations	   from	   Company	   B	   Company	   B	   had	   been	   using	   an	   ERP	   system	   that	   was	   not	   being	   supported	   actively	   by	   the	   software	   provider	   any	   longer	   and	   was	   obsolete.	   As	   a	   result	   the	   company	   B	   was	    looking	    for	    a	    new	    ERP	    system	    to	    suit	    their	    business	    and	    was	    undergoing	    a	   review	    to	    ensure	    that	    their	    business	    processes	    were	    ready	    for	    this	    new	   implementation.	   The	   following	   ERP	   software	   modules	   were	   implemented:	   • Payroll	   • Human	   Resources	   • Procurement	   • Subcontractor	   ordering	   • Accounts	   The	   following	   observation	   was	   made	   at	   Company	   B:	   • It	   was	   found	   that	   the	   existing	   information	   systems	   and	   processes	   (prior	   to	   the	   implementation	   of	   the	   new	   ERP	   system)	   were	   not	   integrated,	   especially	   across	   departments.	   There	   were	   major	   bottlenecks	   between	   departmental	   processes	   that	   resulted	   in	   delay	   in	   overall	   operation.	   This	   phenomenon	   has	   been	    documented	    as	    “islands	    of	    information”	    (Bowden	    et	    al.	    2006).	   However,	    it	    was	    found	    that	    even	    after	    the	    implementation	    of	    new	    ERP	   system	   many	   of	   these	   problems	   still	   remained.	    	   Despite	    this	    major	    implementation	    of	    software	    system	    that	    nearly	    cost	    £0.5	   million,	   the	   production	   management	   processes	   remained	   almost	   unchanged;	   while	   some	   of	   the	   problems	   observed	   with	   the	   construction	   processes	   are	   documented	   below.	   • As	    majority	    of	    work	    was	    executed	    using	    Subcontractors	    (there	    were	    no	   direct	    construction	    workers	    employed	    by	    the	    company),	    managing	   Subcontractors	    was	    a	    major	    task.	    Processes	    range	    from	    Prequalification,	   Subcontract	    Tendering	    (during	    bids),	    Procurement,	    Quality,	    Safety	    and	   most	    importantly	    Production	    (coordination).	    It	    was	    identified	    that	    there	   were	    at	    least	    five	    separate	    subcontractor	    databases	    being	    used	    and	   maintained	    by	    individual	    departments,	    namely	    estimating,	    accounts,	   quantity	   surveying,	   safety	   and	   quality.	    	   • None	    of	    these	    databases	    were	    synchronised	    with	    each	    other	    and	    hence	   caused	    significant	    duplication	    in	    efforts.	    Also,	    due	    to	    this	    lack	    of	   synchronisation,	    significant	    problems	    related	    to	    production	    management	   arose.	   For	   example,	   subcontractors	   who	   were	   blacklisted	   due	   to	   bad	   safety	   records	   were	   routinely	   selected	   by	   QSs	   and	   Estimators	   to	   work	   on	   projects.	   The	    accounts	    department	    routinely	    queried	    the	    QSs	    regarding	    particular	   bills	   as	   they	   had	   no	   records	   of	   work	   from	   projects.	   • One	    of	    the	    other	    major	    problems	    identified	    was	    that	    of	    reconciliation	    of	   materials	   received	   and	   payment	   to	   suppliers	   at	   site	   using	   “Goods	   Received	   Notes”	   (GRNs).	   The	   GRNs	   are	   a	   record	   of	   the	   goods	   received	   on	   site	   against	   purchase	   orders.	   They	   record	   the	   item	   description,	   purchase	   order	   number,	   supplier	   name,	   date	   and	   quantity	   received.	   Any	   discrepancies	   between	   the	   purchase	    order	    and	    items	    received	    at	    site	    are	    noted	    here	    to	    ensure	    that	   correct	    payments	    can	    be	    made.	    It	    was	    observed	    at	    company	    B	    that	    there	   was	   a	   general	   lack	   of	   integration	   between	   the	   information	   systems	   used	   by	   procurement,	   accounts	   and	   the	   construction	   sites.	   This	   resulted	   in	   80%	   of	   the	    GRNs	    being	    queried	    for	    a	    number	    of	    reasons.	    This	    not	    only	    caused	   delays	    in	    the	    payment	    to	    suppliers,	    it	    also	    resulted	    in	    significant	    time	   wasting	   for	   both	   accounts	   departments	   and	   project	   managers.	   Some	   of	   the	   reasons	   are	   outlined	   below:	   o As	    the	    working	    conditions	    on	    site	    are	    not	    controlled	    as	    the	    office	   environment,	   the	   condition	   of	   the	   GRNs	   when	   they	   reached	   accounts	   was	   on	   many	   occasions	   quite	   poor.	   Hence,	   they	   were	   not	   legible	   and	   further	   clarification	   was	   required.	   o If	   the	   quantity	   between	   the	   purchase	   order	   and	   supplied	   quantity	   on	   site	   were	   different.	    	   o Material	   supplied	   without	   a	   purchase	   order	   number	   Although	    the	    problems	    outlined	    above	    are	    quite	    significant,	    one	    of	    the	    most	   fundamental	    issues	    was	    that	    (similar	    to	    Company	    A)	    the	    core	    production	   management	   systems	   and	   supporting	   functions	   remained	   almost	   unaffected	   by	   the	   existing	   or	   new	   information	   systems.	   As	   a	   result	   the	   inefficiencies	   present	   in	   the	   construction	    process	    remained	    unaddressed.	    Hence,	    each	    construction	    project	   would	    need	    to	    define	    its	    own	    production	    planning,	    scheduling	    and	    control	   processes	   and	   also	   manage	   the	   implementation	   of	   information	   systems	   to	   support	   them,	   giving	   rise	   to	   some	   critical	   problems,	   which	   are	   outlined	   below:	   • Communication	   and	   management	   of	   project	   information	   remained	   a	   critical	   issue.	   Around	   10	   projects	   were	   studies	   where	   it	   was	   found	   that	   almost	   two	   hours	    were	    spent	    daily	    to	    manage	    emails	    where	    almost	    50-­‐60%	    of	    that	   information	   was	   duplicated.	   Even	   after	   implementing	   a	   dedicated	   extranet	   (project	    information	    system)	    the	    problem	    remained,	    as	    the	    information	   remained	   isolated	   from	   the	   production	   system.	   • Drawing	   Management:	   Majority	   of	   the	   design	   and	   production	   information	   received	   was	   either	   through	   paper	   or	   CAD	   drawings.	   These	   were	   scanned	   and/or	   then	   printed	   and	   sent	   off	   to	   sites	   via	   post	   by	   Head	   Office.	   As	   design	   changes	    can	    be	    frequent	    the	    process	    remained	    quite	    intensive	    and	    the	   volume	    of	    drawings	    remained	    quite	    high.	    This	    caused	    significant	    costs	    in	   postage.	    Also,	    there	    was	    a	    major	    communication	    problem	    as	    it	    was	    not	   always	   possible	   to	   ascertain	   whether	   all	   subcontractors	   were	   working	   with	   the	   latest	   copy	   of	   the	   design/drawing/specification.	   The	   following	   incident	   occurred	   as	   a	   result:	   o During	    a	    project	    a	    subcontractor	    claimed	    not	    to	    have	    received	    the	   latest	   version	   of	   the	   drawing,	   which	   led	   to	   a	   major	   incident	   on	   site	   leading	    to	    collapse	    of	    a	    structure.	    However,	    due	    to	    the	    lack	    of	    an	   electronic	    audit	    system,	    it	    could	    not	    be	    proved	    whether	    the	   subcontractor	   had	   or	   had	   not	   received	   the	   drawing.	   • There	   were	   a	   number	   of	   general	   information	   management	   related	   problems	   identified,	   as	   the	   existing	   and	   newly	   implemented	   ERP	   system	   still	   did	   not	   address	    some	    of	    the	    core	    functions	    of	    the	    organisation.	    For	    example,	    the	   Prequalification,	    Safety	    and	    Quality	    Management	    processes	    for	    managing	   the	   supply	   chain	   were	   simply	   not	   supported	   by	   any	   information	   systems.	   This	    resulted	    in	    significant	    problems,	    with	    major	    duplication	    of	    efforts,	   information	    bottlenecks	    causing	    delays	    on	    projects,	    and	    inefficiencies	   related	   to	   poor	   information	   availability	   at	   the	   production	   level.	    	   • During	    a	    recent	    discussion	    with	    the	    IT	    Manager	    of	    the	    company,	    after	    5	   years	    of	    implementation,	    many	    of	    the	    problems	    identified	    and	    reported	   previously	   still	   remain.	   3.1.3	   Summary	   –	   Problem	   Awareness	    	   It	    was	    observed	    that	    through	    the	    implementation	    of	    Information	    Systems,	    a	   number	   of	   improvements	   were	   made	   to	   the	   peripheral	   processes,	   communication	   between	    external	    and	    internal	    stakeholders	    and	    partially	    to	    the	    production	   management	    processes.	    However,	    major	    inefficiencies	    were	    still	    found	    with	    the	   integration	    of	    information	    and	    in	    the	    production	    management	    itself.	    The	   performance	    of	    the	    projects	    following	    the	    implementation	    of	    new	    Information	   Systems	   did	   not	   show	   any	   major	   sign	   of	   improvements.	   This	   shaped	   some	   of	   the	   early	    understanding	    of	    the	    practical	    problem	    that	    were	    then	    further	    explored	   through	    literature	    review,	    case	    studies	    and	    focus	    group	    interviews,	    which	    is	   discussed	   in	   subsequent	   sections	   in	   this	   Chapter.	   3.2	    Problems	    with	    production	    management	    in	    construction	    –	    observations	   from	   literature	   There	   has	   been	   extensive	   research	   into	   the	   causes	   behind	   the	   problems	   faced	   by	   the	    construction	    industry	    over	    the	    years.	    A	    number	    of	    such	    causes	    have	    been	   identified,	    for	    example,	    contractual	    problems,	    theoretical	    problems,	    inefficient	   production	    management	    systems,	    ineffective	    product	    representations	    and	   specifically	   the	   unsuccessful	   use	   of	   IT.	   The	   scope	   and	   focus	   of	   this	   research	   is	   on	   production	   management	   in	   construction	   specifically,	   hence	   a	   detailed	   review	   of	   the	   problems	   facing	   the	   production	   management	   processes	   has	   been	   carried	   out.	    	   Navon	    and	    Sacks	    (2007)	    have	    reported	    about	    the	    requirements	    of	    information	   management	   in	   production	   management	   and	   control.	   They	   report	   that	   production	   facilities	    require	    control	    processes	    in	    order	    to	    produce	    desired	    products.	    The	   control	    processes	    involve	    bi-­‐directional	    flow	    of	    information	    –	    forward	    flow	    to	   direct	   the	   behaviour	   of	   the	   process,	   and	   feedback	   information	   from	   the	   process	   to	   the	    controlling	    function.	    They	    criticise	    the	    monitoring	    system	    in	    construction	   industry	   as	   slow	   and	   primitive	   and	   put	   forward	   the	   following	   as	   main	   reasons:	   i. Dynamic	   project	   systems	   for	   construction	   product	   delivery	   ii. Ad-­‐hoc	    organisation	    of	    disparate	    companies	    with	    limited	    or	    no	    long	   term	   working	   relations	   iii. And	   the	   control	   processes	   relying	   on	   manual	   data	   processing	   methods	   which	   are	   slow,	   inaccurate	   and	   expensive	   Formoso	   and	   Isatto	   (2008)	   describe	   the	   main	   flaws	   in	   production	   management	   as	   following:	   • Production	   management	   and	   planning	   is	   interpreted	   simply	   as	   preparing	   a	   Gantt	   chart	   (such	   as	   in	   CPM),	   and	   not	   much	   effort	   is	   made	   to	   synchronise	   accurate	    project	    information	    (Laufer	    and	    Tucker,	    1987).	    The	   synchronisation	   of	   production	   information	   is	   made	   even	   more	   difficult	   due	   to	   several	   organisations	   involved	   in	   a	   single	   project,	   where	   in	   most	   cases	   each	   stakeholder	   uses	   their	   own	   information	   systems.	   • There	   is	   a	   general	   lack	   of	   formal	   systems	   dedicated	   to	   the	   control	   aspect	   in	   production	    management,	    where	    it	    usually	    depends	    on	    verbal	    exchanges	   between	   site	   teams	   and	   supervisors/managers.	   Control	   is	   also	   dependent	   on	    short-­‐term	    decisions	    and	    is	    seldom	    linked	    to	    long-­‐term	    plans,	    which	   contributes	   to	   a	   number	   of	   problems,	   especially	   in	   case	   of	   resources	   with	   long	    lead	    times	    and	    custom	    engineered	    components,	    which	    are	    made	    to	   order	   (Formoso,	   1991).	   • Many	    construction	    companies	    tend	    to	    emphasise	    the	    control	    related	    to	   global	    project	    aims,	    and	    fulfilment	    of	    contracts,	    rather	    than	    production	   control.	    In	    this	    context,	    spotting	    problems	    in	    the	    production	    system	    and	   defining	   corrective	   lines	   of	   action	   often	   become	   problematic	   (Ballard	   and	   Howell,	   1997).	   • Unpredictability	   is	   a	   common	   problem	   in	   construction	   planning	   especially	   due	    to	    dynamic	    site	    conditions,	    however	    is	    still	    not	    recognised	    in	    the	   production	   management	   system.	   Hence,	   the	   necessary	   means	   to	   overcome	   or	    address	    uncertainty	    are	    absent	    from	    the	    production	    management	   systems	    (Cohenca	    et	    al.,	    1989).	    This	    is	    also	    reflected	    in	    the	    fact	    that	    in	   construction	   projects,	   detailed	   long	   term	   plans	   are	   prepared	   which	   become	   obsolete	   from	   start,	   and	   to	   keep	   such	   plans	   updated	   becomes	   a	   highly	   time	   consuming	   affair	   (Laufer	   and	   Tucker,	   1987).	   • Information	    and	    communication	    technology	    (ICT)	    systems	    have	    not	    been	   very	    effective	    in	    production	    planning	    as	    they	    are	    mostly	    procured	    and	   implemented	    without	    assessing	    and	    identifying	    users’	    requirements.	    This	   leads	    to	    further	    instability	    in	    production	    management	    and	    creates	    waste	   through	    irrelevant	    and	    large	    amount	    of	    information	    that	    do	    not	    support	   proactive	    elimination	    of	    problems	    but	    only	    informs	    about	    them	    (Sanvido	   and	   Paulson,	   1992).	   Traditionally,	   information	   systems	   are	   implemented	   in	   an	    isolated	    fashion	    where	    they	    are	    not	    integrated	    with	    other	    internal	    or	   external	    systems.	    User	    training	    and	    awareness	    in	    using	    advance	   information	   system	   also	   remains	   a	   problematic	   issue	   (Turner,	   1993).	    	   • Due	   to	   some	   of	   the	   problems	   outlined	   above,	   such	   as	   a	   lack	   of	   a	   systematic	   approach	   to	   synchronise	   and	   present	   production	   information	   and	   also	   due	   to	   the	   “T”	   based	   approach	   in	   management,	   most	   construction	   managers	   rely	   on	    their	    own	    experience,	    intuition	    to	    take	    decisions	    leading	    to	    further	   uncertainty	   (Lantelme	   and	   Formoso,	   2000).	   The	    following	    section	    discusses	    these	    and	    additional	    problems	    related	    to	   production	   management	   in	   construction	   in	   further	   detail.	   3.2.1	   Product	   and	   Process	   Visualisation:	    	   One	    of	    the	    largest	    problems	    in	    production	    management	    is	    that	    of	    insufficient	   visualisation	   of	   project	   information	   (Kymmell,	   2008).	   The	   visualisation	   of	   project	   or	    production	    information	    can	    be	    classified	    in	    two	    categories,	    i)process	   visualisation;	   and	   ii)product	   visualisation.	   The	   problem	   of	   visualisation	   spans	   the	   entire	   lifecycle	   from	   design	   to	   construction,	   handover	   and	   facility	   operations	   and	   maintenance.	    For	    example,	    if	    the	    client	    requirements	    are	    not	    fully	    visualised,	   understood	   and	   communicated,	   they	   cannot	   be	   represented	   correctly	   in	   the	   design	   and	    specification	    and	    leads	    to	    subsequent	    problems	    during	    construction	    and	   operation	    of	    a	    facility.	    Similarly,	    difficulties	    in	    visualising	    production	    related	   information	   in	   the	   right	   context	   creates	   significant	   problems	   during	   the	   production	   planning	   and	   execution	   stage.	   The	   production	   related	   information	   encompasses:	    	   • The	   process	   related	   information	   such	   as	   that	   of	   input	   flows	   –	   i.e.	   material,	   equipment,	   labour,	   connecting	   works,	   space,	   etc.,	   • Product	    visualisation	    –	    i.e.	    information	    regarding	    what	    is	    to	    be	    built,	    the	   information	   that	   is	   usually	   referred	   as	   design	   information	   and	   consists	   of	   2D	   CAD	   drawings	   or	   3D	   BIM	   models,	   and	   also	   includes	   information,	   such	   as	   quantity,	   specifications,	   fitting	   instructions,	   etc.	   dos	    Santos	    et	    al.	    (1998)	    defined	    transparency	    of	    the	    process	    as	    “the	    ability	    of	    a	   production	   process	   (or	   its	   parts)	   to	   communicate	   with	   people”.	   The	   authors	   add	   that	    the	    implementation	    of	    transparency	    at	    the	    organisational	    and	    at	    the	   operational	   level	   in	   the	   form	   of	   simplification,	   motivation,	   rapid	   understanding	   of	   information	   and	   such	   is	   quite	   advantageous	   (Greif	   1989).	    	   Formoso	    et	    al.	    (2002)	    have	    compiled	    a	    list	    of	    benefits	    of	    process	    transparency	   relevant	   from	   the	   construction	   perspective:	   i. In	    workplaces	    where	    the	    layout	    changes	    frequently,	    effective	    location	   information	   aids	   people	   to	   identify	   workstations	   and	   pathways.	   ii. Display	    of	    information	    at	    the	    workplace	    improves	    the	    effectiveness	    of	   production	   planning	   and	   control.	   iii. Visual	   communication	   tends	   to	   increase	   the	   involvement	   of	   workers	   in	   continuous	   improvement	   efforts	   since	   it	   allows	   rapid	   comprehension	   of	   and	   response	   to	   problems.	   iv. Control	    is	    simplified,	    reducing	    the	    propensity	    for	    errors	    and	    making	   them	   more	   visible.	   v. Process	   transparency	   has	   a	   positive	   impact	   on	   motivation.	   However,	   despite	   the	   advantages,	   the	   construction	   industry	   is	   far	   behind	   in	   use	   of	   such	    principles	    and	    have	    very	    few	    visual	    mechanisms	    to	    inspire,	    instruct	    or	   motivate	    workers	    to	    carry	    out	    their	    jobs	    more	    effectively,	    efficiently	    and	    safely	   (dos	   Santos	   et	   al.,	   1998).	   3.2.2	   Unavailability	   of	   production	   related	   information	   at	   the	   “coal	   face”:	   Project	    managers,	    site	    managers	    and	    foreman	    (and	    in	    general	    the	    construction	   team)	   rely	   on	   accurate	   and	   up-­‐to-­‐date	   (real-­‐time)	   information	   about	   production	   to	   manage	    the	    project	    and	    resources.	    The	    absence	    of	    real-­‐time	    production	   management	    systems	    –	    systems	    that	    provide	    a	    complete	    set	    of	    production	   management	    related	    information	    makes	    this	    task	    cumbersome	    and	    inefficient	   where	   a	   significant	   amount	   of	   time	   is	   required	   to	   extract	   information	   from	   various	   sources	   (such	   as	   extranet,	   intranet,	   ERP	   systems,	   emails,	   faxes	   and	   other	   mean	   of	   communication).	    It	    also	    reduces	    their	    ability	    to	    manage	    the	    variability	    and	   uncertainty	    inherent	    in	    project	    activities.	    (Navon	    and	    Sacks,	    2007,	    Howell	    and	   Koskela,	   2000).	   A	   survey	   carried	   out	   by	   Fruchter	   (2001)	   reported	   that	   the	   need	   for	   the	   data	   entry	   at	   the	   project	   level	   is	   one	   of	   the	   biggest	   bottlenecks	   to	   the	   success	   of	   the	   production	   management	   system	   as	   a	   whole.	   Research	   carried	   out	   by	   McCulloch	   (1997)	   reported	   that,	   on	   average,	   30-­‐50%	   of	   the	   time	   of	   construction	   personnel	   on	   site	    is	    spent	    in	    recording	    and	    analysing	    production	    related	    data.	    However,	    on	    a	   practical	   level,	   there	   has	   been	   little	   progress	   to	   help	   construction	   teams	   efficiently	   handle	    data	    collection	    and	    provide	    timely	    and	    accurate	    information	    (Navon	    and	   Sacks,	   2007).	   This	   problem	   is	   explored	   further	   in	   detail	   in	   section	   3.4.	   3.2.3	   Problems	   with	   the	   integration	   of	   supply	   chain	   The	   UK	   construction	   industry	   is	   highly	   fragmented	   with	   a	   large	   number	   of	   small	   companies	    operating	    in	    the	    sector.	    Over	    the	    last	    30	    years	    the	    industry	    has	   increasingly	    grown	    risk	    averse	    and	    relies	    mostly	    on	    subcontracted	    workers	    to	   execute	    projects.	    (Dainty	    et	    al.,	    2001).	    Figure	    7	    shows	    the	    distribution	    of	    the	   construction	   firms	   in	   three	   major	   European	   countries	   –	   UK,	   France	   and	   Germany	   (compared	    with	    USA).	    Figure	    7	    below	    shows	    that	    almost	    90%	    of	    the	    firms	   operating	   in	   the	   country	   are	   micro	   organisations	   (1-­‐9	   employees),	   and	   9.4%	   are	   small	   (50-­‐249),	   where	   the	   Large	   and	   Medium	   size	   only	   form	   0.7%	   of	   the	   overall	   proportion.	   This	   demonstrates	   the	   amount	   of	   fragmentation	   that	   exist	   within	   the	   UK	   (and	   European)	   construction	   sector,	   and	   the	   challenge	   it	   poses	   especially	   from	   the	    integration	    perspective.	    As	    recognised	    above,	    production	    management	   requires	    communication	    and	    availability	    of	    information	    at	    the	    crucial	    stages	    of	   production.	   This	   information	   is	   often	   generated	   from	   and	   has	   to	   be	   communicated	   across	    the	    supply	    chain.	    The	    severe	    fragmentation	    present	    in	    the	    supply	    chain	   makes	    it	    increasingly	    difficult	    for	    this	    information	    to	    be	    synchronised	    and	   communicated	    at	    the	    right	    time.	    Dainty	    et	    al.	    (2001)	    report	    that	    the	    UK	   construction	    sector	    is	    a	    long	    way	    from	    being	    able	    to	    achieve	    true	    supply	    chain	   integration	   and	   that	   an	   adversarial	   culture	   is	   ingrained	   within	   industry’s	   operating	   practices,	   where	   a	   general	   mistrust	   between	   companies	   prevail.	   This	   raises	   further	   dimensions	   to	   the	   existing	   problems	   of	   production	   management	   and	   control.	   	   Figure	   7.	   Proportion	   of	   UK	   Construction	   Firms	   by	   Size	   (DTI,	   2004).	   Since	   early	   1990s	   research	   into	   the	   supply	   chain	   management	   structure	   of	   construction	   industry	   has	   been	   on-­‐going	   with	   a	   view	   to	   explore	   the	   possibilities	   of	   transferring	   manufacturing	   concepts	   to	   construction	   in	   order	   to	   improve	   production	   efficiency	   and	   reduce	   project	   costs	   (Azambuja	   and	   O’Brien	   et	   al.,	   2008).	   However,	   construction	   supply	   chains	   are	   distinctly	   different	   from	   manufacturing	   sector	   and	   direct	   applications	   of	   management	   principles	   may	   not	   be	   possible.	   This	   is	   made	   evident	   in	   recent	   studies	   carried	   out	   by	   Vaidyanathan	   and	   O’Brien	   (2003);	   Green	   et	   al.	   2005;	   and	   London	   and	   Kenley	   (2001),	   where	   the	   authors	   have	   highlighted	   key	   differences	   and	   opportunities	   in	   applying	   manufacturing	   concepts	   to	   construction	   from	   a	   supply	   chain	   perspective.	   Azambuja	   and	   O’Brien	   (2008)	   provide	   a	   summary	   of	   the	   key	   differences	   between	   manufacturing	   and	   construction	   supply	   chains	   as	   shown	   in	   Table	   2.	   Table	   2.

However,	    on-­‐site	    production	    inefficiency	    is	    often	    caused	    by	    poor	    production	   planning	    (which	    includes	    decisions	    on	    buffers)	    and	    limited	    planning	    concerning	   the	   impact	   of	   off-­‐site	   production	   and	   delivery	   variability.	   To	   mitigate	   the	   risk	   of	   variability	   the	   common	   practice	   is	   to	   amass	   vast	   inventory	   of	   resources	   including	   space,	   material,	   labour,	   equipment	   and	   even	   production	   tasks,	   which	   is	   a	   form	   of	   a	   major	   waste.	   The	   increase	   in	   complexity	   of	   construction	   projects	   and	   market	   dynamics,	   results	   in	    increase	    in	    the	    level	    of	    fragmentation.	    This	    creates	    further	    difficulties	    in	   coordinating	   the	   supply	   chain	   as	   (Azambuja	   and	   O’Brien,	   2008):	   • The	   number	   of	   planning	   activities	   and	   alternatives	   increases	   dramatically;	   • Divergent	    stakeholder	    interests	    need	    to	    be	    managed	    (Wiendahl	    et	    al.,	   2005);	    	   • Lack	   of	   understanding	   of	   the	   project	   by	   different	   participants	   (Formoso	   et	   al.,	   2002)	   It	    emerges	    from	    the	    above	    that	    the	    supply	    chain	    management,	    especially	    the	   fragmentation	    of	    the	    supply	    chain,	    and	    the	    temporal,	    site	    based	    production	    in	   construction	    creates	    significant	    problems	    from	    production	    planning	    and	    control	   perspective.	    	   Sacks	    et	    al.

Also	   shown	   in	   Table	   2	   above,	   information	   flow	   aspect	   is	   quite	   poorly	   handled	   in	   the	   construction	   supply	   chain.	   The	   information	   is	   handled	   several	   times	   creating	   waste;	   there	   is	   a	   general	   lack	   of	   information	   system	   to	   support	   the	   production;	   and	   there	   is	   in	   general	   the	   lack	   of	   integration	   between	   supply	   chain	   members.	   This	   problem	   of	   integration	   from	   an	   information	   systems	   perspective	   is	   discussed	   in	   detail	   further	   in	   section	   3.4.	    	   3.3	   Root	   causes	   behind	   the	   problems	   As	    much	    as	    it	    is	    important	    to	    identify	    and	    discuss	    the	    problems	    behind	    the	   production	   management	   process,	   it	   is	   equally	   important	   to	   understand	   what	   are	   the	    causes	    that	    contribute	    to	    these	    problems.	    There	    are	    a	    number	    of	    reasons,	   which	    contribute	    to	    problems	    within	    the	    industry.	    Once	    we	    identify	    the	    causes	   behind	   the	   problems,	   it	   is	   then	   possible	   to	   research	   the	   solution	   to	   overcome	   the	   problems.	    The	    major	    causes	    behind	    the	    problems	    regarding	    the	    production	   management	    and	    control	    processes	    reported	    above	    are	    discussed	    in	    the	    text	   below.	    	   3.3.1	   Current	   construction	   theory	    	   Koskela	   and	   Vrijhoef	   (2000)	   argue	   that	   the	   one	   of	   the	   most	   fundamental	   reasons	   behind	   the	   problems	   within	   the	   construction	   industry	   is	   the	   current	   theory	   behind	   construction,	   which	   is	   implicit	   and	   deficient.	   It	   is	   argued	   by	   the	   authors	   that	   as	   the	   theory	    behind	    construction	    is	    implicit,	    it	    is	    not	    possible	    to	    directly	    transfer	   innovative	   concepts	   such	   as	   lean	   manufacturing	   and	   mass	   customisation.	   Also,	   the	   lack	   of	   an	   explicit	   theory	   prevents	   access	   to	   the	   core	   concepts	   within	   construction.	   This	   in	   turn	   makes	   it	   difficult	   to	   create	   new	   templates	   for	   transfer	   of	   concepts	   such	   as	   lean	   manufacturing.	    	   Koskela	   (2000)	   also	   argues	   that	   the	   prevalent	   theory	   behind	   construction	   is	   the	   one	   of	   transformation	   view	   of	   production.	   The	   transformation	   view	   of	   production	   means:	   • A	   project	   can	   be	   decomposed	   into	   parts	   and	   further	   decomposed	   to	   tasks.	   • It	   is	   assumed	   that	   the	   project	   can	   simply	   be	   managed	   by	   assigning	   tasks	   to	   workers	   and	   making	   inputs	   available	   • Also	    by	    minimising	    cost	    of	    each	    sub-­‐component	    it	    is	    assumed	    that	    the	   project	   cost	   can	   be	   optimised.	   In	   the	   transformation	   view	   of	   production,	   there	   is	   no	   place	   for	   variability	   or	   time.	   It	   is	    well	    understood	    that	    a	    construction	    project	    is	    a	    highly	    dynamic	    environment	   where	    variability	    is	    abundant;	    hence	    the	    transformation	    view	    proves	    highly	   counterproductive.	    Here,	    no	    emphasis	    is	    given	    to	    the	    flow	    (“F”)	    or	    value	    (“V”)	   aspect	   of	   the	   process.	   In	   reality,	   flow	   and	   value	   are	   also	   important	   aspects	   of	   the	   construction	   process,	   as	   no	   process	   is	   performed	   in	   isolation	   and	   several	   resource	   flows	    such	    as	    material,	    labour,	    space,	    connecting	    works	    and	    external	    conditions	   are	    affecting	    the	    process	    simultaneously.	    Also,	    the	    value	    aspect	    helps	    keep	    the	   customer	   and	   their	   requirements	   in	   forefront,	   as	   for	   any	   project;	   it	   is	   the	   customer	   who	   should	   be	   the	   ultimate	   focus.	    	   Koskela	    (2000)	    also	    argues	    that	    taking	    this	    view	    has	    led	    to	    a	    new	    waste	    in	   construction,	    which	    is	    referred	    to	    as	    “making	    do”.	    Here	    negative	    buffering	    takes	   place;	   i.e.	   tasks	   are	   started	   without	   all	   necessary	   inputs	   are	   in	   place.	   This	   is	   one	   of	   the	   most	   common	   waste	   on	   construction	   projects	   according	   to	   Koskela	   (2000)	   as	   construction	   workers	   often	   seek	   innovative	   ways	   to	   solve	   problems	   arising	   due	   to	   the	    neglect	    of	    the	    flow	    aspects	    of	    construction.	    “Making	    do”	    will	    be	    discussed	   further	   in	   Chapter	   4.	    	   The	   lack	   of	   theory	   behind	   construction	   and	   the	   predominance	   of	   the	   “T”	   view	   on	   construction	    has	    not	    only	    caused	    hindrance	    in	    understanding	    the	    construction	   process	    in	    needed	    clarity	    or	    to	    innovative	    solutions	    being	    applied,	    it	    has	    also	   contributed	    to	    inefficient	    project	    planning,	    scheduling	    and	    control	    methods.	   Similarly	    the	    effect	    of	    “T”	    view	    of	    production	    is	    extended	    to	    supporting	    and	   enabling	    systems	    such	    as	    Information	    and	    Communication	    Technology	    systems	   that	   support	   the	   construction	   industry	   (Dave	   et	   al.,	   2008).	   The	   inefficiencies	   of	   the	   production	   planning,	   scheduling	   and	   control	   methods	   and	   the	   problems	   with	   the	   ICT	   systems	   are	   discussed	   in	   the	   subsequent	   sections.	   3.3.2	   Production	   planning,	   scheduling	   and	   control	   methods	    	   Production	    management	    comprises	    of	    three	    distinct	    activities,	    planning,	   scheduling	    and	    control	    (Ballard,	    2000).	    Construction	    is	    often	    criticised	    as	    an	   industry,	    which	    lacks	    streamlined	    processes	    and	    a	    standardised	    production	   management	    system	    (Egan	    1998,	    Latham	    1994,	    Wolstenholme,	    2009).	    On	    most	   projects,	    managers	    and	    site	    personnel	    are	    left	    to	    devise	    their	    own	    production	   management	   and	   control	   system.	   In	   the	   situation	   where	   the	   teams	   are	   efficient	   and	   experienced	   the	   project	   indeed	   benefits	   and	   delivers	   good	   results.	   However,	   it	   can	   be	    said	    that	    on	    other	    occasions	    the	    ad-­‐hoc	    implementation	    of	    processes	    creates	   chaos	   and	   results	   in	   time	   and	   cost	   overruns.	    	   3.3.3	   Planning	   in	   production	   management	   Traditionally,	    in	    construction,	    planning	    is	    considered	    to	    be	    an	    equivalent	    of	   creating	   a	   Gantt	   chart	   of	   tasks	   to	   be	   performed	   (Henrich	   et	   al.,	   2005).	   This	   Gantt	   chart	    on	    most	    occasions	    is	    created	    at	    the	    early	    stage	    of	    the	    project	    at	    the	    head	   office	    without	    consulting	    the	    project	    team	    (Ballard,	    2000).	    At	    this	    stage	    of	    the	   project	   the	   reliability	   of	   information,	   i.e.	   resource	   availability,	   external	   conditions,	   client	   changes	   are	   not	   yet	   available	   and	   hence	   the	   reliability	   of	   the	   plan	   is	   quite	   low	   (Ballard,	    2000).	    However,	    this	    master	    plan	    is	    taken	    as	    the	    base	    document	    and	   pushed	   to	   the	   site	   team	   to	   be	   followed	   regardless	   of	   the	   current	   situation	   on	   the	   ground.	   The	   other	   shortcoming	   of	   this	   plan	   is	   that	   it	   seldom	   shows	   various	   flows	   of	   resources	    such	    as	    labour,	    equipment,	    material	    etc.,	    hence	    the	    site	    team	    has	    to	   decipher	   this	   detail	   on	   their	   own.	   From	   the	   discussion	   about	   current	   ICT	   systems,	   it	    is	    observed	    that	    not	    many	    organisations	    have	    achieved	    complete	    integration	   between	    their	    information	    systems,	    and	    this	    leaves	    the	    site	    team	    without	    the	   critical	   information	   regarding	   these	   resources	   during	   the	   execution	   of	   the	   project.	   Also,	   most	   planning	   methods	   do	   not	   include	   the	   spatial	   information	   in	   the	   plan,	   i.e.	   it	   does	   not	   show	   where	   the	   work	   is	   going	   be	   carried	   out	   and	   how	   to	   resources	   will	   flow	    during	    the	    project	    (i.e.	    smooth	    flow	    of	    resource	    between	    locations	    without	   interruptions).	   This	   leads	   to	   resource	   clashes	   during	   the	   execution;	   i.e.	   two	   work	   teams	    working	    within	    the	    same	    space,	    material	    being	    stacked	    too	    far	    from	    the	   project,	   not	   knowing	   where	   the	   equipment	   are	   or	   when	   they	   will	   be	   available.	   All	   such	   factors	   add	   to	   the	   inefficiencies	   during	   the	   execution	   stage.	   In	   the	   following	   paragraphs	   some	   of	   the	   main	   production	   planning	   and	   control	   systems	   being	   used	   in	   construction	   will	   be	   discussed.	   3.3.3.1	   Critical	   Path	   Method	   (CPM)	    	   The	   CPM	   method	   was	   developed	   by	   DuPont	   and	   Remington	   Rand	   around	   1957.	   It	   was	   developed	   to	   mathematically	   calculate	   the	   sequence	   of	   activities	   in	   order	   to	   complete	   a	   project	   in	   the	   minimum	   time	   possible.	   CPM	   programmes	   show	   activity	   dependencies	   and	   duration	   allocated	   for	   each	   activity.	   It	   also	   allows	   for	   calculating	   the	   float	   of	   an	   activity,	   where	   float	   is	   the	   amount	   of	   time	   a	   non-­‐critical	   activity	   can	   be	    delayed	    without	    affecting	    the	    overall	    programme.	    A	    majority	    of	    construction	   projects	   today	   use	   CPM	   as	   the	   main	   project	   management,	   planning	   and	   controlling	   mechanism.	    It	    is	    the	    most	    popular	    method	    in	    construction	    over	    the	    last	    five	   decades.	    The	    project	    plan	    is	    shown	    using	    Gantt	    charts,	    which	    are	    the	    visual	   representation	   displaying	   activities	   as	   horizontal	   bars	   where	   time	   is	   plotted	   on	   the	   X	   axis.	   Due	   to	   this	   visual	   representation,	   Gantt	   charts	   are	   quite	   easy	   to	   understand	   and	   have	   made	   the	   CPM	   method	   very	   popular	   amongst	   construction	   professionals.	    	   The	   CPM	   method	   can	   be	   seen	   as	   the	   direct	   implementation	   of	   the	   transformation	   view.	   It	   implies	   that	   by	   breaking	   the	   tasks	   into	   smaller	   chunks	   or	   by	   way	   of	   work	   breakdown	    structures,	    a	    project	    can	    be	    managed.	    The	    aspects	    such	    as	    flow	    of	   materials,	   labour,	   equipment	   or	   information	   are	   not	   taken	   into	   account	   (Howell	   &	   Koskela,	   2000).	   CPM	   is	   effective	   in	   providing	   a	   big	   picture	   but	   if	   one	   tries	   to	   add	   information	   such	   as	   material	   and	   labour	   flows,	   it	   starts	   to	   get	   very	   cumbersome	   and	    difficult	    to	    manage	    (Peer,	    1974;	    Birrel,	    1980).	    Also,	    one	    further	    essential	   element	   that	   is	   missing	   from	   the	   CPM	   method	   is	   spatial	   information	   (i.e.	   smooth	   flow	   of	   labour	   and	   resources	   between	   locations).	   It	   is	   understood	   that	   construction	   takes	   place	   in	   space	   and	   time.	   CPM	   addresses	   the	   time	   element	   (although	   not	   in	   a	   complete	    way);	    the	    spatial	    element	    is	    completely	    missing.	    If	    one	    tries	    to	    add	    a	   spatial	    element,	    i.e.	    where	    a	    particular	    task	    will	    be	    carried	    out,	    the	    Gantt	    chart	   starts	    becoming	    too	    complicated	    and	    as	    a	    result,	    is	    seldom	    updated.	    The	   consequence	   is	   that	   without	   the	   spatial	   element,	   the	   programme	   becomes	   difficult	   to	    manage;	    as	    it	    frequently	    leads	    to	    resource	    clashes,	    i.e.	    Two	    labour	    teams	   working	    in	    the	    same	    place	    at	    the	    same	    time	    where	    there	    is	    not	    enough	    space,	   material	   being	   stacked	   in	   the	   wrong	   place,	   crew	   sitting	   idle	   as	   there	   is	   no	   space	   or	   direction	   where	   they	   should	   work	   next,	   etc.	   3.3.3.2	   Line	   of	   Balance	   (LOB)	   Line	   of	   Balance	   is	   a	   linear	   scheduling	   method,	   which	   shows	   the	   tasks	   in	   a	   project	   as	   a	    single	    line	    on	    a	    graph	    as	    opposed	    to	    a	    series	    of	    individual	    activities	    on	    a	   bar/Gantt	    chart.	    It	    is	    mostly	    used	    on	    projects	    where	    there	    are	    a	    number	    of	   repetitive	   activities	   such	   as	   a	   housing	   or	   a	   road	   construction	   project.	   LOB	    was	    originally	    developed	    by	    the	    Goodyear	    Co.	    in	    the	    early	    1940s	    and	    was	   further	   developed	   by	   the	   US	   Navy	   in	   the	   early	   1950s	   for	   programming	   and	   control	   of	   both	   repetitive	   and	   non-­‐repetitive	   projects.	   (Turban	   1968;	   Lutz	   &	   Halpin,	   1992).	   The	    LOB	    technique	    assumes	    that	    the	    rate	    of	    production	    for	    an	    activity	    remains	   uniform	    during	    the	    execution	    time.	    Most	    commonly,	    time	    is	    plotted	    on	    the	   horizontal	   axis	   where	   as	   work	   units	   are	   plotted	   on	   the	   vertical	   axis.	   The	   resultant	   chart	    shows	    sloping	    lines,	    which	    represent	    the	    production	    rate	    of	    an	    activity.	   Another	    characteristic	    of	    the	    LOB	    is	    that	    it	    represents	    work	    activities	    being	   continuously	    performed,	    even	    if	    the	    work	    is	    being	    carried	    out	    in	    different	   locations.	    	   Recently,	   Seppänen	   (2009)	   has	   attempted	   to	   improve	   the	   location	   based	   planning	   tools	    and	    their	    processes.	    In	    the	    research,	    the	    author	    implemented	    the	    location	   planning	   methods	   on	   three	   case	   study	   projects	   and	   studied	   their	   performance.	   It	   was	   observed	   on	   the	   case	   studies	   that,	   even	   after	   project	   activities	   were	   subjected	   to	   cascading	   delays	   from	   an	   initial	   phase,	   the	   actual	   finish	   date	   of	   the	   project	   was	   not	   affected.	   This	   was	   due	   to	   the	   long	   end-­‐buffer	   that	   was	   put	   in	   the	   schedule.	   Also,	   the	    author	    found	    that	    the	    problems	    occurring	    on	    projects	    could	    be	    envisaged	   earlier	   due	   to	   the	   location-­‐based	   control	   data	   available.	    	   LOB	   partially	   addresses	   the	   issue	   of	   spatial	   information,	   as	   there	   is	   a	   possibility	   to	   show	   the	   space	   where	   the	   task	   will	   be	   carried	   out	   over	   time	   on	   the	   activity	   line.	   However,	   there	   are	   limitations	   to	   this	   approach	   as	   it	   works	   well	   in	   projects	   where	   there	   are	   repetitive	   tasks,	   as	   LOB	   does	   not	   work	   well	   where	   the	   project	   has	   many	   unique	   tasks.	   Also,	   the	   issue	   of	   temporary	   structures	   is	   not	   addressed	   by	   the	   LOB	   method.	    A	    typical	    construction	    project	    during	    their	    lifetime	    see	    erection	    and	   demolition	   of	   many	   temporary	   structures,	   which	   have	   to	   be	   managed	   during	   the	   planning	    and	    execution	    stage.	    As	    these	    are	    unique	    in	    nature	    the	    LOB	    approach	   does	   not	   work	   well	   in	   this	   case.	   The	   simple	   nature	   of	   the	   LOB	   charts	   also	   limits	   the	   amount	   of	   information	   that	   can	   be	   shown	   on	   them.	   3.3.3.3	   Critical	   Chain	   Developed	    by	    Goldratt	    (1997),	    Critical	    Chain	    Project	    Management	    (CCPM)	    is	    a	   method	    of	    planning	    and	    managing	    projects	    that	    put	    the	    main	    emphasis	    on	    the	   resources	   required	   to	   execute	   project	   tasks.	   As	   opposed	   to	   other	   methods	   such	   as	   CPM,	   which	   advocate	   rigid	   task	   order	   and	   timeline	   based	   scheduling,	   Critical	   Chain	   requires	   the	   schedule	   to	   be	   flexible	   and	   tries	   to	   keep	   resources	   level	   throughout	   the	   project.	   Overall,	   it	   focuses	   on	   taking	   out	   the	   individual	   task	   “float”	   or	   “buffer”	   and	   allocating	   them	   to	   one	   big	   collective	   buffer.	   It	   assumes	   that	   this	   way	   the	   tasks	   are	   started	   as	   soon	   as	   the	   previous	   one	   finishes	   and	   project	   completes	   on	   time.	   The	   Critical	   Chain	   theory	   is	   based	   on	   the	   Theory	   of	   Constraints	   developed	   by	   Goldratt	   (1997)	   which	   is	   based	   on	   the	   premise	   that	   rate	   of	   goal	   achievement	   is	   limited	   by	   at	   least	   one	   constraining	   process.	   As	   described	   by	   Goldratt	   (1997)	   the	   five	   key	   steps	   in	   organisational/process	   improvement	   are:	   1. Identify	    the	    constraint	    (the	    resource	    or	    policy	    that	    prevents	    the	   organization	   from	   obtaining	   more	   of	   the	   goal)	   2. Decide	   how	   to	   exploit	   the	   constraint	   (make	   sure	   the	   constraint's	   time	   is	   not	   wasted	   doing	   things	   that	   it	   should	   not	   do)	   3. Subordinate	   all	   other	   processes	   to	   above	   decision	   (align	   the	   whole	   system	   or	   organization	   to	   support	   the	   decision	   made	   above)	   4. Elevate	    the	    constraint	    (if	    required	    or	    possible,	    permanently	    increase	   capacity	   of	   the	   constraint;	   "buy	   more")	   5. If,	    as	    a	    result	    of	    these	    steps,	    the	    constraint	    has	    moved,	    return	    to	    Step	    1.	   Don't	   let	   inertia	   become	   the	   constraint.	   Koskela	   et	   al.	   (2010)	   have	   compared	   the	   Critical	   Chain	   Production	   Management	   to	   the	    Last	    Planner	    System™	    within	    the	    context	    of	    construction	    management.	    The	   authors	    summarise	    that	    while	    Critical	    Chain	    endeavours	    to	    shorten	    the	    project	   duration	   with	   cost	   reductions	   (where	   other	   benefits	   are	   secondary),	   Last	   Planner	   primarily	   endeavours	   to	   reduce	   the	   variability	   in	   work	   flows,	   which	   directly	   leads	   to	   increased	   productivity	   and	   cost	   reduction	   along	   with	   gains	   in	   safety	   and	   quality.	   In	   addition,	   Last	   Planner	   helps	   with	   schedule	   compression	   as	   it	   reduces	   variability.	   In	    criticism,	    Koskela	    et	    al.	    (2010)	    mention	    that	    the	    Critical	    Chain	    method	    is	   restricted	   to	   buffer	   management,	   as	   it	   does	   not	   try	   to	   address/reduce	   the	   cause	   of	   the	    buffers	    or	    variability.	    Hence,	    there	    is	    a	    limited	    scope	    for	    productivity	   improvement	    through	    variability	    reduction.	    In	    comparison,	    Last	    Planner	    fails	    to	   maintain	    an	    explicit	    link	    with	    the	    master	    plan	    (Junior	    et	    al.,	    1998),	    hence	    the	   current	    situation	    on	    site	    can	    not	    be	    readily	    assessed	    from	    an	    overall	    project	   perspective.	    Also	    in	    Last	    Planner	    there	    is	    no	    direct	    method	    of	    schedule	   compression	   at	   the	   master	   plan	   level.	   3.3.3.4	   Last	   Planner	   The	   Last	   Planner™	   system	   (Ballard,	   2000)	   –	   as	   the	   name	   suggests	   is	   based	   on	   the	   planning	    and	    scheduling	    that	    is	    carried	    out	    by	    the	    people	    responsible	    for	    the	   execution	    of	    work,	    i.e.	    site	    manager,	    foreman	    and	    work	    crews.	    Traditionally,	   planning	    and	    production	    management	    is	    carried	    out	    with	    a	    top-­‐down	    approach.	   Planners	    mostly	    based	    at	    the	    head	    office	    prepare	    the	    schedules	    right	    at	    the	   estimating	   stage.	   This	   is	   then	   pushed	   to	   site	   teams	   to	   follow	   during	   the	   entirety	   of	   the	   execution	   stage.	   Very	   little	   input	   window	   to	   planning	   is	   left	   for	   the	   site	   teams.	   As	   discussed,	   this	   makes	   the	   execution	   plans	   quite	   unreliable,	   as	   they	   are	   prepared	   when	   there	   is	   not	   much	   reliable	   information	   available.	    	   Last	    Planner	    tries	    to	    overcome	    problems	    of	    traditional	    planning	    methods	    by	   introducing	    shorter	    planning	    cycles	    during	    the	    execution	    stage,	    which	    are	   prepared	   by	   the	   work	   teams	   and	   are	   based	   on	   work	   commitments	   on	   “what	   CAN	   be	   done”	   rather	   than	   “what	   SHOULD	   be	   done”.	   Here,	   the	   master	   schedule	   is	   taken	   as	    a	    guideline,	    and	    informs	    the	    work	    teams	    about	    major	    milestones	    and	    overall	   schedule.	   Based	   on	   the	   master	   schedule	   a	   look	   ahead	   plan	   is	   prepared	   4-­‐6	   weeks	   in	   advance,	   which	   is	   based	   on	   the	   current	   resource	   situation	   and	   up-­‐to-­‐date	   forecasts.	   Further	   to	   this,	   weekly	   meetings	   are	   organised	   where	   all	   work	   teams	   take	   part	   and	   “pull	    tasks”	    from	    the	    look-­‐ahead	    plan.	    Also,	    the	    weekly	    meetings	    are	    used	    to	   analyse	    the	    reasons	    for	    non-­‐completion	    for	    previous	    week’s	    tasks,	    and	    a	    task	    is	   only	    selected	    if	    all	    the	    pre-­‐requisites	    to	    starting	    that	    task	    are	    met.	    This	    clearly	   improves	    the	    reliability	    of	    the	    planned	    work	    and	    improves	    the	    efficiency	    of	   workers.	    The	    method	    also	    builds	    a	    network	    of	    promises,	    as	    each	    week,	    all	   stakeholders	   commit	   to	   the	   work	   being	   planned	   and	   are	   then	   held	   responsible	   for	   the	    same.	    This	    gradually	    builds	    the	    trust	    and	    improves	    social	    environment	   (collaboration)	   on	   site	   as	   all	   units	   operate	   as	   a	   team.	   Last	   Planner	   takes	   into	   account	   the	   flow	   aspects	   of	   the	   construction	   process	   during	   the	   execution	   stage.	   It	   has	   generally	   been	   found	   to	   improve	   the	   reliability	   of	   the	   projects	    due	    to	    the	    increased	    reliability	    of	    the	    plans.	    Here	    the	    responsibility	    of	   production	   control	   shifts	   from	   the	   top	   level	   to	   the	   comparatively	   lower	   ranks	   as	   the	    work	    is	    pulled	    based	    on	    all	    the	    prerequisites	    being	    met.	    On	    the	    other	    hand,	   commitment	   to	   the	   method	   becomes	   a	   prerequisite	   for	   all	   parties.	   As	   a	   result,	   last	   planner	   may	   not	   work	   properly	   in	   situations	   where	   it	   is	   not	   possible	   to	   create	   a	   network	    of	    trust.	    Also,	    in	    organisations	    where	    the	    control	    is	    mostly	    kept	    in	    top	   circles,	    the	    managers	    find	    it	    too	    difficult	    to	    allow	    the	    site	    team	    to	    control	    the	   production	   process.	   Again,	   in	   cultures	   where	   this	   is	   the	   case	   the	   system	   might	   not	   work	   in	   its	   current	   form	   (i.e.	   it	   may	   need	   adapting	   to	   suit	   the	   cultural	   and	   process	   issues).	    	   Even	    though	    the	    Last	    Planner	    system	    takes	    into	    account	    the	    variability	    in	    the	   process,	    it	    does	    not	    go	    beyond	    the	    weekly	    planning	    meetings.	    A	    construction	   project	   is	   a	   dynamic	   environment	   and	   much	   could	   happen/change	   during	   the	   span	   of	    a	    week.	    Reliability	    can	    be	    further	    improved	    if	    a	    shorter	    planning	    cycle	    is	   introduced	   (Sacks	   et	   al.,	   2009).	   3.3.3.5	   Summary	   of	   planning	   methods	    	   Despite	    its	    shortcomings	    CPM	    remains	    one	    of	    the	    most	    popular	    methods	    being	   taught	    and	    used	    in	    the	    academia	    and	    the	    industry.	    The	    majority	    of	    construction	   planning	    and	    scheduling	    software	    are	    also	    based	    around	    CPM.	    The	    linear	   scheduling	    methods	    help	    in	    selective	    projects	    but	    cannot	    provide	    an	    overall	   solution	    to	    the	    industry.	    Critical	    Chain	    is	    not	    yet	    followed	    in	    the	    mainstream	   construction	    and	    is	    undergoing	    further	    research.	    It	    has	    some	    parallels	    with	    the	   Last	   Planner	   System,	   and	   it	   can	   be	   argued	   that	   they	   complement	   each	   other	   well.	   The	   Last	   Planner™	   system	   of	   production	   management	   and	   control	   is	   beginning	   to	   become	    popular	    where	    there	    is	    a	    reasonably	    supportive	    environment	    for	    its	   implementation.	    It	    can	    be	    concluded	    that	    there	    is	    a	    need	    for	    a	    streamlined	   construction	    process	    through	    a	    systematic	    implementation	    of	    a	    production	   management	   and	   control	   system	   which	   takes	   into	   account	   the	   transformation,	   flow	   and	   value	   concepts.	   3.4	   Information	   and	   Communication	   System	   Problems	   in	   Construction	    	   Managing	    production	    related	    information	    is	    critical	    for	    construction	    projects	    as	   discussed	   in	   section	   3.1	   above.	   It	   was	   also	   observed	   in	   3.2	   that	   due	   to	   relatively	   deep	    and	    complex	    supply	    chain	    on	    construction	    projects,	    it	    is	    critical	    to	    ensure	   effective	    communication	    between	    the	    parties	    to	    enable	    smooth	    and	    error	    free	   production	   planning,	   scheduling	   and	   control.	   Information	    technologies	    have	    been	    evolving	    at	    a	    rapid	    pace	    in	    the	    last	    two	   decades.	   Especially,	   the	   Internet	   revolution	   in	   the	   90s	   has	   led	   to	   a	   significant	   shift	   in	   business	   and	   industrial	   processes	   around	   the	   world	   (Howard	   et	   al.	   1998;	   Rivard	   2000).	    This	    has	    led	    to	    organisations	    investing	    heavily	    in	    technology	   implementation	    in	    terms	    of	    hardware	    and	    software	    solutions.	    The	    same	    can	    be	   found	    in	    the	    construction	    industry.	    The	    growing	    trend	    of	    ICT	    implementation	   within	   construction	   is	   reflected	   in	   various	   surveys	   carried	   out	   around	   the	   world	   (Arif	    and	    Karam,	    2001;	    Samuelson,	    2002;	    Ingirige	    and	    Aouad,	    2001;	    Issa	    et	    al.,	   2003;	   Tas	   and	   Irlayici,	   2007).	   However,	   recent	   literature	   and	   research	   has	   shown	   that	    the	    industry	    has	    not	    yet	    been	    able	    to	    gain	    the	    desired	    benefits	    from	    ICT	   projects.	   (Pena-­‐Mora	   et	   al.	   1999;	   Tatari	   et	   al.	   2007;	   Nitithamyong	   and	   Skibniewski	   2003).	    Frustrations	    related	    to	    Information	    Systems	    implementations	    are	    not	   limited	   to	   the	   construction	   industry	   alone.	   Legris	   et	   al.	   (2002)	   have	   reported	   that	   only	   26%	   of	   all	   MIS	   (Management	   Information	   Systems)	   projects	   are	   completed	   on	   time	   and	   within	   budget,	   with	   all	   requirements	   fulfilled.	   Some	   of	   the	   reasons	   behind	   this	   lack	   of	   effectiveness	   of	   the	   ICT	   systems	   to	   bring	   desired	   benefits	   are	   explained	   below.	   3.4.1	   Shortcomings	   of	   the	   current	   design	   and	   product	   modelling	   systems:	   Construction	   drawings	   (2D)	   have	   been	   traditionally	   considered	   to	   be	   a	   language	   with	   which	   professionals	   within	   construction	   industry	   communicate.	   In	   the	   1760s,	   a	   precise	   standardised	   method	   for	   representing	   three	   dimensional	   objects	   called	   descriptive	    geometry	    in	    two	    dimensions	    was	    developed	    by	    the	    Frenchman	   Gaspard	   Monge	   (Koskela	   et	   al.,	   2010).	   The	   method	   was	   deemed	   so	   powerful	   that	   it	   was	   kept	   in	   secrecy	   for	   many	   years,	   and	   Monge	   published	   the	   details	   only	   in	   1799	   (Kant,	   1799).	   Since	   then,	   descriptive	   geometry	   has	   been	   the	   basis	   for	   construction	   design	    drawings.	    Together	    with	    written	    description,	    such	    as	    bills	    of	    materials,	   drawings	   have	   been	   used	   to	   represent	   the	   object	   to	   be	   built,	   both	   for	   contractual	   purposes	   and	   for	   site	   execution	   (Koskela	   et	   al.,	   2010).	   A	    number	    of	    Computer	    Aided	    Design	    (CAD)	    software	    have	    been	    developed	    over	   the	   years,	   which	   facilitate	   generation	   and	   distribution	   of	   drawings.	   However,	   due	   to	   the	   fragmentation	   prevalent	   in	   the	   construction	   industry,	   the	   ability	   to	   interpret	   these	   drawings	   on	   a	   project	   varies	   from	   one	   subcontractor	   to	   the	   other.	   Also,	   due	   to	   increasing	   complexity	   of	   building	   systems,	   drawings	   have	   become	   much	   difficult	   to	   interpret	   even	   for	   the	   technically	   competent.	   Computer	   Aided	   Design	   does	   not	   intrinsically	    support	    generation	    of	    intelligent	    design,	    whereas	    the	    objects	   contained	    within	    the	    drawings	    demonstrate	    behavioural	    patterns	    and	    where	   design	   objects	   can	   be	   controlled	   in	   a	   parametric	   way.	    	   Current	    practice	    in	    using	    2D	    CAD	    is	    that	    the	    designers	    and	    engineers	    develop	   solutions	    independent	    of	    each	    other.	    However,	    there	    is	    no	    potential	    solution	    to	   automatically	   check	   the	   design	   for	   consistency,	   and	   due	   to	   complexity	   of	   design,	   manual	   checking	   is	   quite	   difficult.	   This	   leads	   to	   design	   errors	   and	   inconsistencies,	   which	    are	    then	    identified	    on	    site	    and	    are	    costly	    to	    fix.	    Also,	    it	    is	    not	    possible	    to	   automate	   tasks	   such	   as	   fabrication	   using	   CNC	   systems	   using	   CAD	   drawings,	   or	   to	   check	    the	    design	    for	    potential	    clashes	    between	    various	    components	    such	    as	   building	    structure	    and	    facilities.	    It	    is	    also	    not	    possible	    to	    build	    fail-­‐safe	    rules	   (design	   templates	   to	   ensure	   standard	   conformance)	   using	   2D	   CAD	   systems.	   On	   the	   contrary,	   object	   oriented	   design	   development,	   which	   is	   offered	   by	   Building	   Information	    Modelling	    software,	    is	    capable	    of	    representing	    intelligent	    behaviour	   and	   can	   integrate	   a	   multitude	   of	   information	   from	   various	   sources.	   (Eastman	   et	   al.	   2008).	   The	    problems	    with	    the	    traditional	    2D	    CAD	    technologies	    during	    the	    construction	   project	    lifecycle	    are	    discussed	    below.	    The	    stages	    described	    below	    could	    be	   different	    in	    sequence	    depending	    on	    the	    type	    of	    the	    contractual	    agreement,	    for	   example	    Design-­‐Bid-­‐Build	    or	    Design-­‐Build.	    In	    Design-­‐Build	    and	    partnership	   projects,	   some	   of	   the	   inefficiencies	   of	   the	   traditional	   process	   described	   below	   are	   taken	   care	   of,	   however,	   the	   critical	   inefficiencies	   related	   to	   the	   production	   phase	   most	   likely	   remain.	    	   3.4.1.1	   Problems	   during	   Pre-­‐Construction	    	   The	    key	    goal	    of	    the	    conceptual	    design	    stage	    is	    to	    capture	    the	    functional	    and	   aesthetic	   requirements	   from	   the	   client	   and	   translate	   that	   into	   design	   intent.	   This	   makes	    design	    a	    highly	    iterative	    process,	    where	    initially	    a	    significant	    amount	    of	   refinement	   is	   taking	   place	   and	   client	   input	   is	   being	   taken	   into	   account.	   The	   current	   paper	   based	   process	   leads	   to	   significant	   inefficiencies,	   as	   it	   is	   not	   easy	   to	   interpret	   and	    communicate	    the	    design	    intent	    about	    a	    three	    dimensional	    space	    in	    a	    two-­dimensional	   drawing	   (potentially	   for	   an	   untrained	   eye	   of	   the	   client).	   Also,	   through	   the	   paper-­‐based	   process,	   critical	   project	   based	   information	   such	   as	   cost	   estimates	   and	    performance	    evaluation	    (such	    as	    energy,	    acoustics,	    structural,	    thermal,	    etc.)	   has	    to	    be	    carried	    out	    post	    design	    and	    manually.	    Often,	    when	    inefficiencies	    are	   found	    with	    the	    design,	    it	    is	    too	    late	    to	    make	    a	    change,	    which	    then	    leads	    to	   compromises	   with	   client’s	   original	   intentions.	    	   3.4.1.2	   Problems	   during	   Tendering	   and	   Bid	   Process	    	   Traditional	   contracts	   based	   on	   the	   lowest	   bid,	   involve	   a	   strenuous	   bidding	   process,	   where	   contractors	   spend	   at	   least	   1%	   of	   the	   estimated	   project	   costs	   on	   compiling	   bids	    (Eastman	    et	    al.,	    2011).	    These	    bids	    are	    developed	    using	    paper	    based	    or	   electronic	   2D	   drawings,	   where	   manual	   extraction	   of	   quantities	   and	   interpretation	   of	   design	   is	   required.	   As	   a	   result,	   significant	   amount	   of	   time	   and	   effort	   is	   required	   in	   preparing	   the	   bid.	   If	   we	   consider	   a	   contractor’s	   hit	   rate	   as	   20%	   (i.e.	   they	   win	   1	   job	   for	   every	   5	   bids),	   the	   1%	   of	   bid	   development	   cost	   gets	   added	   to	   the	   overheads.	   Also,	    due	    to	    major	    inconsistencies	    in	    design,	    a	    significant	    amount	    of	    RFIs	    are	   generated	   even	   during	   the	   bid	   stages	   as	   the	   main	   contractor	   has	   to	   take	   input	   from	   their	   supply	   chain	   to	   arrive	   at	   a	   final	   cost.	   	   		   3.4.1.3	   Problems	   during	   Design	   and	   Detail	    	   Developing	   a	   detailed	   design	   is	   a	   highly	   collaborative	   and	   iterative	   process,	   where	   a	   number	   of	   design	   consultants	   contribute	   towards	   the	   final	   design.	   The	   current	   2D	    CAD	    and	    design	    processes	    do	    not	    lend	    themselves	    for	    collaborative	    design	   development.	   Most	   commonly	   an	   over-­‐the-­‐wall	   approach	   is	   taken	   towards	   design	   where	   each	   consultant	   (Architect,	   Structural,	   MEP,	   etc.)	   develops	   their	   respective	   design	   and	   passes	   it	   to	   the	   next	   as	   an	   input.	   This	   makes	   the	   process	   a	   very	   lengthy	   and	   costly.	   Also,	   due	   to	   the	   fragmented	   nature	   of	   design	   development,	   many	   issues	   related	    to	    physical	    clashes	    between	    different	    design	    elements	    (i.e.	    architectural	   and	    structural	    or	    structural	    and	    MEP	    etc.)	    remain	    undetected	    until	    the	   construction	    stage	    of	    the	    project.	    This	    leads	    to	    either	    rework	    or	    lengthy	    delays	   during	   the	   construction	   process.	   A	    study	    carried	    out	    by	    Freire	    and	    Alarcón	    (2002)	    diagnosed	    and	    evaluated	    the	   traditional	    design	    process	    for	    three	    projects	    of	    a	    design	    consultant.	    The	    authors	   used	   lean	   principles	   to	   identify	   wastes	   present	   within	   the	   process	   and	   found	   the	   main	   wastes	   occurring	   within	   the	   process	   to	   be:	   1. Ignorance	   of	   client	   requirements;	   2. Bureaucracy	   and	   paper	   work;	   3. Interdisciplinary	   coordination;	   4. Information	   not	   available;	   and	   5. Rework.	   Freire	    and	    Alarcón	    (2002)	    also	    identified	    time	    distribution	    in	    traditional	    design	   process	   as	   shown	   in	   Table	   3	   below:	   Table	   3.	   Distribution	   of	   time	   in	   design	   tasks	   (Freire	   and	   Alarcón,	   2002).	   Category Duration (%) Designing 50.2 Verifying information 8.2 Collecting information 28.1 Correcting information 12.2 Issuing 1.4 The	   results	   from	   table	   above	   clearly	   show	   that	   the	   value	   adding	   activity	   of	   actual	   design	   work	   contributes	   to	   only	   50.2%	   time	   spent	   on	   this	   overall	   process,	   where	   the	   rest	   constitute	   wasteful	   tasks.	   3.4.1.4	   Problems	   during	   Construction	   Phase	    	   It	   is	   during	   the	   construction	   stage	   that	   the	   inefficiencies	   of	   the	   traditional	   design	   cause	   the	   biggest	   problems	   (Eastman	   et	   al.,	   2011,	   Kymmell,	   2008).	    	   • Rework	   due	   to	   inaccuracies	   or	   lack	   of	   detail:	   As	   the	   design	   is	   not	   normally	   checked	   for	   constructability	   and	   refined	   for	   execution,	   a	   thorough	   review	   takes	   place	   early	   in	   the	   project	   to	   identify	   errors	   and	   omissions.	    	   • Lack	    of	    support	    for	    Prefabrication:	    Also,	    the	    lack	    of	    automation	    and	   parametric	    abilities	    of	    the	    2D	    design	    makes	    is	    difficult	    to	    support	    a	   prefabrication	    strategy;	    hence	    most	    of	    the	    components	    have	    to	    be	   constructed	   on	   site,	   leading	   to	   inefficiencies.	    	   • Clashes	    leading	    to	    rework:	    Two	    types	    of	    clashes	    could	    occur,	    physical	   clashes;	   i.e.	   construction	   elements	   clashing	   with	   each	   other	   as	   design	   hasn’t	   been	    refined	    or	    process	    clashes;	    where	    the	    work	    sequence	    hasn’t	    been	   properly	   planned	   due	   to	   lack	   of	   visualisation.	   This	   causes	   either	   a	   delay	   in	   work	   or	   complete	   rework	   of	   construction	   elements.	   • Drawing	    Management:	    Drawing	    or	    design	    issue	    management	    becomes	   highly	   complex	   and	   inefficient	   in	   a	   2D	   CAD/	   paper	   based	   process.	   This	   leads	   to	    not	    only	    inefficiencies	    on	    construction	    projects,	    but	    also	    causes	    safety	   issues	    as	    probability	    of	    subcontractors	    working	    with	    a	    wrong	    revision	    of	   drawings	   increases.	   On	   a	   case	   study	   A	   a	   major	   accident	   happened	   where	   a	   subcontractor	   used	   an	   old	   revision	   of	   drawing	   to	   construct	   a	   concrete	   slab.	   This	    led	    to	    the	    failure	    of	    the	    slab	    and	    injury	    of	    two	    personnel.	    The	   subcontractor	    claimed	    that	    they	    had	    not	    received	    the	    latest	    copy	    of	    the	   drawing.	   Also,	   on	   an	   average	   it	   was	   found	   for	   company	   A	   that	   the	   expenses	   for	    postage	    and	    scanning	    of	    paper	    drawings	    were	    in	    the	    region	    of	    £200-­£300	   (excluding	   personnel	   costs).	   • Visualisation	    of	    design	    during	    planning:	    It	    is	    highly	    important	    that	    the	   production	    teams	    and	    project	    managers	    are	    familiar	    with	    the	    design	    and	   complexity	    of	    tasks	    while	    planning	    and	    scheduling	    production	    tasks.	   However,	   with	   2D	   drawings	   it	   becomes	   quite	   difficult	   to	   visualise	   3D	   spaces	   and	    how	    the	    production	    will	    happen	    over	    a	    timeline,	    especially	    if	    it	    is	    a	   complex	    structure.	    Also,	    quite	    often	    it	    is	    realised	    during	    the	    project	    that	   required	   information	   from	   drawings	   and	   specifications	   is	   either	   missing	   or	   not	    clear.	    This	    leads	    to	    significant	    number	    of	    Requests	    for	    Information	   (RFIs)	   being	   sent	   to	   and	   from	   the	   project.	   It	   is	   widely	   documented	   that	   RFIs	   lead	   to	   major	   inefficiencies	   during	   a	   construction	   project.	   3.4.1.5	   Problems	   with	   Handover	   and	   Post	   Construction	    	   There	   are	   two	   important	   issues	   the	   project	   has	   to	   address:	   • Handing	   over	   an	   accurate	   record	   and	   information	   about	   the	   facility	   to	   the	   owner	   • Ensuring	    the	    information	    handed	    over	    supports	    effective	    operation	    and	   maintenance	   of	   the	   facility	   Normally	   at	   the	   end	   of	   a	   project,	   all	   the	   as-­‐built	   information	   is	   sorted	   and	   archived	   in	   boxes,	   which	   are	   then	   handed	   over	   to	   the	   client.	   However,	   as	   the	   information	   is	   mostly	   recorded	   on	   paper,	   this	   resource	   is	   hardly	   ever	   used	   or	   synchronized	   with	   a	   client’s	    facilities	    management	    system	    as	    demonstrated	    in	    the	    Maryland	    General	   Hospital	   case	   study,	   which	   was	   documented	   by	   the	   author	   (Eastman	   et	   al.,	   2011).	   The	   following	   observations	   were	   made	   in	   the	   case	   study:	   • The	    lifecycle	    of	    the	    equipment	    was	    not	    optimized,	    i.e.	    the	    facitilities	   management	    system	    did	    not	    take	    into	    consideration	    issues	    such	    as	   maintenance	   intervals,	   servicing,	   etc.	    	   • Warranty	   and	   other	   product-­‐related	   information	   were	   not	   easily	   accessible.	   • No	   ready	   inventory	   of	   equipment	   was	   available.	   The	   resulting	   processes	   are	   quite	   informal	   and	   dependent	   on	   knowledge	   gathered	   by	   experienced	   staff	   members	   about	   the	   facilities	   operations	   over	   the	   years.	   As	   a	   result,	    the	    hospital	    ends	    up	    spending	    considerable	    resources	    on	    Facilities	   Management	    but	    does	    not	    get	    the	    results	    it	    needs.	    The	    BIM-­‐enabled	    process	    for	   recording	   and	   delivering	   as-­‐built	   information	   offered	   an	   opportunity	   to	   record	   and	   provide	   accurate	   as-­‐built	   information,	   in	   a	   form,	   which	   helps	   maintain	   and	   manage	   the	   facilities	   in	   an	   efficient	   way	   and	   increase	   the	   lifecycle	   of	   the	   building.	   3.4.2	   Effectiveness	   of	   ICT	   in	   Construction	   The	   earlier	   view	   taken	   regarding	   ICT	   implementation	   was	   a	   very	   simple	   one,	   that	   simply	   implementing	   ICT	   solutions	   will	   bring	   significant	   improvements	   on	   its	   own.	   No	   significance	   was	   given	   to	   integration	   of	   people	   and	   process	   issues,	   resulting	   in	   less	    than	    satisfactory	    outcomes	    (Dave	    et	    al.,	    2008).	    Limitations	    of	    this	    approach	   were	   soon	   realised	   and	   efforts	   were	   put	   into	   integrating	   process	   issues	   along	   with	   ICT	    implementation.	    Business	    process	    reengineering/redesign	    (BPR)	    initiatives	   advocate	    the	    importance	    of	    integration	    process	    with	    information	    systems.	   However,	   BPR	   became	   more	   of	   a	   buzzword	   and	   focus	   shifted	   to	   reorganising	   the	   workforce	   and	   processes	   rather	   than	   integrating	   information	   systems	   with	   people	   and	   processes.	   Socio-­‐technical	   approaches	   have	   tried	   to	   address	   the	   challenge	   of	   integrating	   people	   issues	   with	   information	   systems.	   However,	   this	   approach	   lacks	   the	    much-­‐needed	    focus	    on	    process.	    It	    can	    be	    concluded	    that	    prior	    views	    on	   integrating	   the	   three	   core	   elements	   of	   business	   have	   been	   of	   limited	   effectiveness	   as	   they	   have	   only	   partially	   addressed	   the	   problem.	   Koskela	    and	    Kazi	    (2003)	    have	    discussed	    the	    effectiveness	    of	    ICT	    within	    the	   construction	    sector.	    They	    have	    reported	    that	    although	    ICT	    has	    improved	   productivity	    on	    a	    general	    level	    as	    far	    as	    individual	    tasks	    are	    concerned,	   productivity	   of	   the	   industry	   on	   the	   whole	   has	   not	   benefited.	   Specifically	   the	   site	   and	   project	   management	   activities	   have	   not	   been	   addressed	   properly	   by	   the	   ICT	   implementations.	   A	   number	   of	   studies	   in	   impacts	   of	   ICT	   in	   construction	   are	   cited	   where	    the	    findings	    have	    indicated	    that	    even	    if	    high	    levels	    of	    benefit	    from	    ICT	   systems	    are	    found	    in	    design	    and	    administration	    type	    of	    work,	    site	    management	   and	   other	   construction	   related	   activities	   have	   remained	   virtually	   unaffected.	   And	   in	   certain	   cases	   of	   subcontractors	   and	   clients,	   the	   impact	   has	   indeed	   been	   negative.	   An	    even	    more	    worrying	    trend	    is	    reported	    by	    the	    authors,	    which	    states	    that	   increased	   spend	   in	   IT	   has	   resulted	   in	   decreased	   productivity	   and	   safety	   standards.	   At	   the	   core	   of	   construction	   there	   are	   physical	   processes,	   which	   are	   supported	   by	   information	   flows	   among	   others.	   Generally,	   most	   ICT	   projects	   in	   construction	   aim	   to	   improve	   these	   supporting	   information	   flows	   and	   hope	   that	   this	   will	   improve	   the	   whole	    process.	    However,	    if	    the	    actual	    production	    process	    is	    as	    chaotic	    as	   construction	   the	   implementation	   of	   ICT	   will	   not	   bring	   desired	   results,	   if	   not	   make	   it	   even	   worse.	   This	   view	   is	   supported	   by	   a	   survey	   carried	   out	   by	   McKinsey	   and	   London	   School	   of	   Economics	    (Appel	    et	    al.,	    2004)	    where	    productivity	    trends	    of	    around	    100	   companies	   across	   France,	   Germany,	   UK	   and	   the	   United	   States	   were	   surveyed	   in	   a	   period	   from	   1994-­‐2002.	   The	   survey	   showed	   that	   investing	   solely	   in	   ICT	   offerings	   has	    a	    very	    little	    impact	    on	    company’s	    performance	    unless	    accompanied	    by	   operational	   change;	   and	   that	   regardless	   of	   the	   company’s	   size,	   location,	   sector	   or	   past	    performance,	    better	    management	    practices	    improve	    organisational	   productivity.	   This	   is	   reflected	   in	   the	   results	   where	   lean	   manufacturing	   and	   better	   people	    management	    practices	    such	    as	    performance	    management	    and	    talent	   management	   coupled	   with	   ICT	   implementation	   brings	   20%	   productivity	   increase,	   whereas	   isolated	   implementation	   of	   ICT	   brings	   only	   2%	   productivity	   increase	   and	   management	   practices	   result	   in	   8%	   increase.	   The	   survey	   rated	   the	   companies	   from	   0-­‐5	   in	   how	   they	   utilised	   the	   three	   important	   tools,	   Figure	   8	   shows	   the	   results	   from	   the	   survey.	    	   Figure	   8.

Various	    departments	    across	    the	    construction	    team	    use	    their	    own	   software	    systems,	    which	    results	    in	    duplication	    of	    efforts	    and	    less	    efficient	   processes.	   This	   problem	   of	   lack	   of	   interoperability	   is	   widely	   known	   in	   the	   industry	   as	    one	    of	    the	    core	    issues	    affecting	    use	    of	    Information	    Systems	    within	    the	   construction	   industry.	   This	   coupled	   with	   fragmented	   nature	   of	   construction	   supply	   chain	   adds	   to	   the	   problem	   of	   information	   integration	   across	   the	   industry	   (Alshawi	   and	   Ingirige,	   2003).	    	   The	   earlier	   consensus	   amongst	   researchers	   has	   been	   that	   implementing	   enterprise	   resource	    planning	    (ERP)	    systems	    results	    in	    a	    well-­‐integrated	    system,	    which	    will	   reduce	   duplication	   of	   work	   and	   increase	   efficiency	   in	   general.	   However,	   in	   a	   study	   carried	   out	   by	   Tatari	   et	   al.	   (2007)	   in	   the	   current	   state	   of	   construction	   enterprise	   information	    systems	    (CEIS),	    findings,	    which	    are	    contrary	    to	    this	    belief,	    are	   reported.	   As	   shows	   in	   Table	   4,	   the	   survey	   has	   shown	   that	   only	   16%	   of	   participants	   were	    satisfied	    with	    their	    current	    level	    of	    integration	    from	    their	    CEIS	   implementation	    where	    only	    4%	    actually	    achieved	    full	    integration	    between	   systems.	   Table	   4.

As	   a	   consequence,	   companies	   end	   up	   spending	   enormous	   amounts	   of	    money	    behind	    their	    IT	    investment,	    which	    in	    fact	    take	    them	    towards	    rigidity	   rather	    than	    innovative,	    efficient	    and	    responsive	    business	    processes.	    In	    a	    study	   carried	    out	    at	    MIT	    (Massachusetts	    Institute	    of	    Technology)	    (Ross,	    et.al,	    2006)	   where	   400	   companies	   were	   studied,	   it	   was	   reported	   that	   IT	   departments	   are	   seen	   as	   cost	   sinks	   and	   liabilities	   rather	   than	   centres	   for	   innovation.	   In	   contrast,	   Liker	   (2003)	   has	   pointed	   out	   that	   Toyota	   in	   the	   automobile	   sector	   has	   remained	    flexible	    (in	    comparison	    with	    its	    competitors)	    by	    selecting	    only	    those	   information	   and	   communication	   (ICT)	   opportunities	   that	   were	   needed	   and	   which	   could	   reinforce	   the	   business	   processes	   directly,	   and	   by	   making	   sure	   by	   testing	   that	   they	   were	   an	   appropriate	   “fit”	   to	   the	   organisational	   infrastructure	   (people,	   process	   and	   other	   ICT).	   Shelbourn	   et	   al.	   (2007)	   have	   discussed	   that	   to	   leverage	   maximum	   potential	    from	    ICT	    projects	    there	    must	    be	    harmonisation	    of	    these	    three	    key	   strategies.	    In	    a	    survey	    carried	    out	    by	    the	    authors	    on	    the	    importance	    of	    3	    key	   strategies	    for	    effective	    collaboration,	    40%	    respondents	    attributed	    importance	    to	   people,	   34%	   to	   business	   processes	   and	   26%	   to	   technology	   as	   shown	   in	   Figure	   9.

Importance	   of	   three	   key	   strategies	   in	   projects	   (Shelbourn	   et	   al.,	   2007).	   3.4.4	   Summary	   of	   ICT	   Problems	   in	   Construction:	    	   It	    can	    be	    seen	    from	    the	    discussion	    that	    the	    efforts	    in	    the	    last	    2-­‐3	    decades	    to	   implement	   technological	   innovation	   have	   not	   brought	   satisfactory	   results	   for	   the	   construction	    industry.	    Much	    has	    been	    done	    to	    improve	    processes,	    which	    are	   peripheral,	    by	    imitating	    other	    industries,	    but	    efforts	    to	    improve	    the	    core	   construction	    processes	    have	    not	    been	    made.	    Also,	    the	    people	    aspect	   (organisational	    structure	    and	    addressing	    user	    requirements)	    has	    not	    been	   addressed.	   The	   capabilities	   in	   the	   construction	   sector	   are	   still	   quite	   varying.	    	   Specifically	    from	    the	    production	    management	    perspective	    the	    ICT	    systems	    are	   expected	    to	    address	    the	    core	    production	    process	    and	    also	    product	    visualisation	   side-­‐by-­‐side.	   However,	   none	   of	   the	   mainstream	   systems	   can	   address	   the	   needs	   of	   the	   dynamic	   nature	   of	   production	   on	   construction	   projects.	    	   3.5	   Synchronisation,	   Visualisation	   and	   Integration	   From	    the	    production	    management	    viewpoint,	    the	    aspects	    of	    Information	   Integration,	    Visualisation	    and	    Synchronisation	    emerge	    as	    the	    most	    important	   factors	   from	   the	   study	   of	   previous	   research	   and	   literature,	   and	   direct	   observation.	   It	    also	    emerges	    that	    although	    these	    are	    understood	    to	    be	    some	    of	    the	    most	   important	   aspects,	   the	   current	   production	   management	   systems	   do	   not	   effectively	   tackle	    them.	    Whereas	    some	    of	    the	    existing	    systems	    address	    these	    aspects	   separately,	   there	   is	   a	   general	   lack	   of	   a	   system	   that	   would	   have	   all	   three	   features	   in	   a	    single	    system.	    For	    example,	    it	    could	    be	    argued	    that	    a	    Building	    Information	   Modelling	    system	    such	    as	    Autodesk	    Navisworks,	    Tekla	    Structures	    (Construction	   Management),	    etc.	    provide	    a	    visualisation	    platform	    in	    form	    of	    a	    4D	    model	    (i.e.	   integration	   of	   the	   Master	   plan	   with	   the	   BIM	   model),	   yet	   it	   does	   not	   synchronise	   the	   production	    planning	    and	    control	    information	    (i.e.	    current	    information	    about	    the	   production	    status	    or	    detailed	    planning),	    and	    it	    does	    not	    integrate	    with	    other	   information	    sources	    such	    as	    procurement	    or	    resource	    management	    system.	   Similarly	    a	    lean	    production	    management	    system	    such	    as	    LEWIS	    (Sriprasert	    and	   Dawood,	    2003)	    does	    not	    integrate	    directly	    with	    a	    BIM	    model	    or	    synchronise	   information	   in	   real-­‐time.	    	   All	   three	   aspects	   of	   visualisation,	   integration,	   and	   synchronisation	   have	   to	   be	   taken	   also	    from	    product	    and	    process	    viewpoints,	    i.e.	    it	    is	    about	    synchronisation,	   visualisation	   and	   integration	   of	   product	   and	   process	   information	   when	   designing	   a	   production	   management	   system.	   3.6	   Summary	   In	   general,	   a	   two-­‐fold	   problem	   emerges	   from	   analysis	   of	   past	   literature	   in	   the	   area	   of	    production	    management	    in	    construction.	    First	    is	    that	    the	    production	   management	    system	    itself	    has	    problems	    in	    construction	    industry,	    where	    the	    “T”	   view	    has	    been	    prominent.	    The	    “T”	    view	    leads	    to	    waste	    not	    only	    during	    the	   construction	    phase	    but	    also	    through	    the	    whole	    construction	    project	    life	    cycle.	   Other	    factors	    such	    as	    fragmented	    supply	    chain,	    inefficient	    planning	    and	    control	   system	   and	   high	   variability	   in	   productivity	   rates	   all	   seem	   to	   stem	   from	   this	   very	   fundamental	    problem,	    which	    can	    also	    be	    linked	    to	    the	    lack	    of	    effective	    theory	   behind	   construction	   management.	    	   On	   the	   other	   hand,	   despite	   the	   recent	   advances	   in	   ICT	   systems	   and	   a	   considerable	   increase	    in	    ICT	    spend	    within	    the	    construction	    industry,	    the	    results	    are	    not	    yet	   favourable.	   In	   fact	   in	   some	   instances	   the	   productivity	   levels	   have	   dropped	   due	   to	   inefficient	   or	   ineffective	   implementation	   of	   ICT	   systems.	   The	   main	   problem	   behind	   this	    can	    also	    be	    linked	    to	    the	    predominance	    of	    “T”	    view	    while	    implementing	    or	   designing	   ICT	   systems	   for	   construction,	   as	   they	   tend	   to	   support	   the	   optimisation	   goals	   of	   individual	   processes	   and	   functions	   rather	   than	   the	   production	   system	   as	   a	   whole.	    This	    has	    led	    to	    problems	    related	    to	    three	    distinct	    aspects	    of	    information	   management	    in	    construction,	    namely	    those	    of	    integration,	    synchronisation	    and	   visualisation.	    It	    is	    found	    that	    all	    these	    three	    aspects	    are	    important	    from	    lean	   production	   management	   perspective,	   but	   current	   information	   systems	   being	   used	   in	   construction	   do	   not	   adequately	   support	   them.	    	   It	   was	   also	   observed	   in	   this	   Chapter	   that	   the	   current	   product	   modelling	   systems	   such	    as	    2D	    (and	    up	    to	    some	    extent	    3D)	    CAD	    are	    not	    capable	    to	    efficiently	   communicate	    the	    requirements	    of	    today’s	    complex	    projects	    and	    introduce	   significant	   inefficiencies	   in	   the	   process.	    	   These	   views	   from	   literature	   are	   supported	   by	   the	   direct	   observation	   made	   by	   the	   author	    while	    working	    within	    the	    construction	    industry.	    In	    two	    cases	    reported,	   distinct	    problems	    related	    with	    “islands	    of	    information”	    or	    non-­‐	    integrated	   information	    systems	    were	    found.	    And	    despite	    significant	    investments	    in	    ICT	   systems	    to	    overcome	    these	    problems,	    they	    failed	    to	    address	    the	    predominant	   problems	    faced	    by	    the	    companies,	    especially	    in	    the	    area	    of	    production	   management.	   Project	   performances	   still	   remained	   relatively	   un-­‐affected	   after	   the	   implementation	   of	   major	   ICT	   systems,	   as	   these	   new	   systems	   did	   not	   address	   the	   core	   construction	   processes.	   Hence	    it	    can	    be	    deduced	    that	    in	    order	    to	    solve	    these	    problems	    related	    to	   production	   management,	   any	   new	   system	   would	   have	   to	   address	   the	   product	   and	   process	    management	    in	    an	    integrated	    fashion.	    Any	    new	    approach	    needs	    to	    take	   care	    of	    the	    “flow”	    and	    “value”	    generation	    aspect	    alongside	    the	    “transformation”	   aspect.	   And	   most	   importantly,	   the	   newly	   designed	   production	   management	   system	   should	    also	    address	    the	    aspects	    of	    information	    integration,	    synchronisation	    and	   visualisation	   simultaneously.	    	   Overall,	    it	    can	    mentioned	    that	    the	    industry	    needs	    a	    capable	    production	   management	   and	   control	   system,	   which	   also	   takes	   into	   account	   the	   spatial	   nature	   of	   the	   construction	   process	   and	   which	   addresses	   all	   three	   -­‐	   “TFV”	   elements	   of	   the	   production	   system.	   		   
4	   Lean	   Construction	   and	   Building	   Information	   Modelling:	   potential	   solutions	   to	   the	   problems	   In	    constructive	    research,	    the	    next	    step	    after	    the	    identification	    of	    a	    practically	   relevant	   problem	   is	   in	   depth	   familiarisation	   with	   the	   research	   area.	   This	   is	   the	   first	   step	   towards	   developing	   a	   solution	   to	   the	   previously	   identified	   problem.	   Following	   the	    exploration	    of	    problems	    in	    Chapter	    3,	    it	    emerged	    that	    the	    industry	    needs	    a	   capable	   production	   management	   and	   control	   system,	   which	   also	   takes	   into	   account	   the	    spatial	    nature	    of	    the	    construction	    process,	    especially	    from	    the	    context	    of	   visualisation	    and	    which	    addresses	    all	    three	    -­‐	    “TFV”	    elements	    of	    the	    production	   system.	    This	    Chapter	    provides	    an	    in-­‐depth	    summary	    of	    potential	    solutions	    that	   help	   achieve	   these	   goals.	    	   To	    begin	    with,	    Lean	    Construction	    as	    a	    potential	    solution	    towards	    production	   management	   problems	   is	   explored.	   Here,	   the	   TFV	   theory	   of	   production,	   effects	   of	   the	   “T”	   view	   and	   “making	   do”	   as	   waste	   in	   the	   construction	   are	   explained,	   which	   is	   followed	    by	    the	    practical	    solutions	    offered	    by	    the	    Last	    Planner™	    system	    of	   production	   control	   and	   Visual	   Management	   techniques.	    	   Following	    the	    discussion	    on	    Lean	    Construction	    and	    the	    Last	    Planner	    system,	   Building	   Information	   Modelling	   as	   a	   potential	   solution	   to	   product	   visualisation	   and	   the	   opportunity	   to	   integrate	   it	   with	   Lean	   Production	   systems	   to	   achieve	   integrated	   visualisation	   of	   product	   and	   process	   during	   production	   management	   is	   explored.	   This	   then	   leads	   to	   the	   development	   of	   a	   potential	   solution	   through	   an	   integrated	   production	   management	   approach.	   4.1	   What	   is	   Lean	   Construction	   Lean	   Construction	   can	   be	   defined	   as	   a	   set	   of	   new	   processes	   which	   are	   grounded	   on	   a	   new	   theory	   of	   production	   and	   which	   help	   improve	   the	   efficiency	   of	   construction	   by	   providing	   better	   value	   to	   the	   client	   and	   reducing	   waste	   from	   the	   process.	   This	   section	    explores	    the	    theoretical	    foundations	    and	    the	    tools	    and	    techniques	   associated	    with	    lean	    construction	    that	    specifically	    addresses	    the	    production	   management	   in	   construction.	   4.1.1	   TFV	   theory	   of	   Construction:	    	   Koskela	   (2000)	   argues	   that	   there	   are	   three	   aspects	   to	   a	   production	   system,	   namely	   transformation,	   flow	   and	   value,	   or	   in	   short	   T,	   F	   and	   V,	   and	   all	   three	   are	   critical	   for	   efficient	   functioning	   of	   any	   production	   management	   system.	   Before	   going	   further	   into	   the	   TFV	   theory	   and	   how	   it	   works,	   it	   critical	   to	   understand	   the	   effects	   of	   relying	   solely	   on	   the	   “T”	   view	   for	   production.	   4.1.1.1	   Transformation	    	   The	   “T”	   view	   of	   production	   has	   remained	   dominant	   during	   the	   whole	   20th	   century	   in	    all	    major	    industries	    including	    manufacturing,	    automotive	    and	    construction	   barring	    a	    few	    exceptions	    such	    as	    Toyota.	    In	    the	    “T”	    view,	    production	    is	    mainly	   managed	    by	    breaking	    the	    whole	    project	    into	    parts	    or	    work	    assignments	    called	   tasks.	    These	    tasks	    are	    then	    assigned	    to	    workers	    or	    teams	    and	    are	    managed	   relatively	    independent	    of	    each	    other.	    From	    economic	    perspective,	    to	    lower	    the	   production	   costs,	   the	   costs	   are	   optimized	   at	   the	   task	   level,	   i.e.	   cost	   of	   each	   task	   is	   minimized	   to	   reduce	   the	   cost	   of	   the	   whole	   product.	   Koskela	   et	   al.	   (2002)	   argue	   that	   the	   “T”	   view	   has	   two	   main	   deficiencies:	   	i. 	It	   fails	   to	   recognise	   other	   phenomena	   in	   production	   other	   than	   “T”	   (such	   as	        “Flow”	   and	   “Value”)	   ii. It	    fails	    to	    recognise	    that	    it	    is	    not	    the	    “T”	    itself	    that	    makes	    the	    output	   valuable,	    but	    instead	    there	    is	    value	    in	    having	    the	    output	    conform	    to	    the	   customer’s	   requirements.	   This	    is	    not	    to	    say	    that	    the	    “T”	    view	    is	    not	    needed,	    quite	    the	    opposite.	    It	    is	    a	   fundamental	   view	   to	   identify	   what	   tasks	   are	   needed	   realise	   production,	   however	   it	   does	    not	    help	    understand	    how	    to	    minimise	    wastage	    and	    improve	    or	    realise	   production	   value.	    	   4.1.1.2	   Flow	    	   There	   have	   been	   other	   recommendations	   on	   production	   management	   such	   as	   that	   by	   Gilbreth	   and	   Gilbreth	   (1922)	   who	   first	   suggested	   the	   idea	   of	   production	   as	   flow.	   This	   view	   led	   to	   the	   “production	   line”	   concept	   that	   was	   pioneered	   by	   Henry	   Ford	   and	   transpired	   into	   “Just	   in	   Time”	   view	   of	   production	   eventually	   leading	   to	   the	   idea	   of	   lean	   production.	   However,	    Henry	    Ford’s	    production	    line	    idea	    was	    mainly	    misunderstood,	    until	    it	   was	   redeveloped	   by	   Taichi	   Ohno	   at	   Toyota	   in	   1940s	   and	   onwards.	   The	   flow	   view	   is	   at	   the	   core	   of	   lean	   philosophy	   and	   it	   emphasises	   that	   there	   should	   be	   a	   continuous	   drive	    to	    eliminate	    waste	    from	    all	    flow	    processes.	    Tools	    such	    as	    Value	    Stream	   Mapping,	   Lead	   Time	   Reduction,	   Just	   in	   Time	   and	   Variability	   Reduction	   all	   support	   the	   flow	   view	   of	   production.	   4.1.1.3	   Value	    	   One	   of	   the	   more	   difficult	   views	   to	   understand	   and	   much	   less	   explored	   is	   the	   “value”	   view	   of	   production.	   Here	   the	   core	   premise	   of	   production	   is	   value	   generation	   for	   customer.	    Developed	    or	    articulated	    in	    the	    1930s	    where	    it	    was	    initiated	    by	   Shewhart	   (1931),	   the	   value	   phenomenon	   was	   brought	   to	   the	   forefront	   again	   by	   the	   quality	   movement	   mainly	   in	   the	   manufacturing	   sector.	    	   4.1.1.4	   Summary	   TFV:	   Koskela	   (2000)	   argues	   that	   rather	   than	   being	   competitive	   or	   contradictory,	   these	   views	   are	   in-­‐fact	   complementary.	   In	   the	   absence	   of	   a	   theory	   for	   production,	   Koskela	   (2000)	   puts	   forward	   a	   combined	   “TFV”	   theory	   of	   production,	   which	   takes	   a	   holistic	   view	   of	   production	   from	   all	   three	   viewpoints.	   An	   overview	   of	   this	   “TFV”	   theory	   as	   opposed	   to	   individual	   counterparts	   is	   provided	   in	   Table	   5	   below.	   As	   it	   can	   be	   observed,	   the	   individual	   doctrines	   and	   principles	   representing	   each	   of	   the	   viewpoints	   are	   not	   new	   at	   all,	   but	   when	   combined	   they	   provide	   a	   perspective	   and	   guidelines	   to	   help	   model,	   structure,	   control	   and	   improve	   production	   (Koskela	   et	   al.,	   2002).	    	   	   		   Table	   5.

(2012)	   provide	   a	   brief	   history	   of	   the	   concept	   of	   waste	   in	   production,	   and	   emphasise	   the	   importance	   to	   understand	   it	   within	   the	   context	   of	   production.	   The	    authors	    mention	    that	    although	    it	    is	    a	    foundational	    notion	    for	    the	    Toyota	   Production	   System	   and	   in	   general	   the	   concept	   of	   lean,	   it	   is	   not	   recognised	   well	   in	   the	    theory	    of	    economics,	    operations	    management,	    construction	    management	    or	   management	   in	   general.	   The	   authors	   found	   through	   their	   research	   that	   the	   up	   to	   the	   end	   of	   the	   18th	   century	   there	   was	   little	   if	   any	   recognition	   of	   waste,	   and	   it	   only	   emerged	    in	    the	    19th	    century	    and	    flourished	    during	    the	    emergence	    of	    scientific	   management.	    However	    it	    declined	    starting	    from	    the	    second	    quarter	    of	    the	    20th	   century,	    and	    re-­‐emerged	    in	    the	    last	    quarter	    of	    the	    20th	    century	    with	    the	    Toyota	   Production	   Management	   System.	    	   Liker	   (2004)	   mention	   that,	   the	   elimination	   of	   waste	   is	   at	   the	   heart	   of	   the	   Toyota	   Production	    System,	    and	    this	    along	    with	    the	    concept	    of	    continuous	    flow	    and	   improvement,	    were	    how	    Taiichi	    Ohno	    made	    Toyota	    a	    very	    efficient	    car	   manufacturer.	   Ohno,	   who	   strived	   to	   drive	   out	   waste	   from	   the	   end-­‐to-­‐end	   process	   rather	   than	   optimising	   individual	   functions,	   considered	   following	   7	   as	   main	   wastes	   within	   the	   production	   system	   (Liker	   2004):	   • Overproduction:	    Any	    items	    produced,	    which	    are	    not	    ordered	    by	    the	   customer,	    are	    considered	    overproduction.	    Overproduction	    causes	    excess	   stock,	    and	    inventory,	    and	    may	    lead	    to	    other	    waste	    such	    as	    unnecessary	   transport	   or	   rework.	   In	   construction,	   any	   work	   that	   is	   carried	   out	   “outside	   the	    schedule”,	    i.e.	    was	    not	    planned	    in	    advance,	    can	    be	    considered	   overproduction.	   • Waiting	   (time	   on	   hand):	   Production	   workers	   having	   to	   wait	   to	   carry	   out	   the	   next	   planned	   activity	   is	   considered	   waiting	   time	   or	   waste.	   Also,	   time	   spent	   in	    watching	    automated	    equipment	    (such	    as	    concrete	    mixers)	    is	    also	   considered	    waste.	    Reasons	    for	    waiting	    time	    could	    be	    lack	    of	    inventory,	   equipment	   downtime,	   resource	   unavailability	   etc.	    	   • Unnecessary	    transport	    or	    conveyance:	    Any	    movement	    of	    workers	   associated	   with	   transporting	   material	   or	   equipment,	   “in	   process”	   work,	   or	   finished	   parts	   etc.	   long	   distance	   is	   considered	   waste.	   In	   construction,	   this	   could	    mean	    transport	    of	    precast	    elements,	    or	    concrete,	    movement	    of	   workers.	   The	   reason	   for	   this	   could	   be	   lack	   of	   attention	   given	   to	   site	   design,	   bottlenecks	   on	   worker	   movement	   routes,	   etc.	   • Overprocessing	    or	    incorrect	    processing:	    Any	    unnecessary	    steps	    or	    action	   taken	   to	   carry	   out	   work	   can	   be	   considered	   overprocessing.	   Also,	   producing	   work	    that	    is	    of	    higher	    quality	    then	    required/ordered	    is	    also	    considered	   overprocessing.	    	   • Excess	   inventory:	   One	   of	   the	   most	   important	   waste	   considered	   by	   Ohno	   is	   excess	    inventory.	    Finished	    parts	    which	    are	    produced	    out	    of	    turn	   (unplanned)	   and	   waiting	   to	   be	   processed	   further	   are	   also	   considered	   excess	   inventory.	    Excess	    inventory	    causes	    problems	    such	    as	    bottlenecks	    in	   processing,	   reduced	   safety,	   defects,	   etc.	   • Unnecessary	   movements:	   Unnecessary	   motion,	   including	   having	   to	   search	   for	    information,	    looking	    for	    resources,	    etc.	    is	    considered	    unnecessary	   movement.	    	   • Defects:	    Work	    that	    is	    completed	    but	    is	    defective	    or	    requires	    rework	    is	   considered	   defects.	   All	    the	    above	    wastes	    exist	    in	    construction,	    however,	    Koskela	    (2004)	    introduces	   another	   category	   of	   waste	   in	   construction	   called	   “making	   do”,	   which	   is	   discussed	   below.	   4.1.2.1	   Making	   do	    	   When	   one	   puts	   this	   new	   point	   in	   front	   of	   the	   existing	   construction	   practices,	   many	   shortcomings	    arising	    from	    the	    sole	    “T”	    implementation	    start	    becoming	    obvious.	   Crucially,	   this	   leads	   to	   a	   new	   category	   of	   waste	   called	   “Making	   Do”	   (Koskela,	   2004).	    	   Making-­‐do	   as	   a	   waste	   refers	   to	   a	   situation	   where	   a	   task	   is	   started	   without	   all	   its	   standard	   inputs,	   or	   the	   execution	   of	   the	   task	   is	   continued	   although	   the	   availability	   of	    at	    least	    one	    standard	    input	    has	    ceased.	    The	    term	    input	    refers	    not	    only	    to	   materials,	    but	    to	    all	    other	    inputs	    such	    as	    machinery,	    tools,	    personnel,	    external	   conditions,	    instructions	    etc.	    Especially	    in	    production	    situations	    where	    there	    are	   several	    uncertain	    inflows	    to	    the	    task	    (such	    as	    construction),	    making	    do	    is	    a	   common	   phenomenon,	   and	   requires	   explicit	   attention	   (Koskela,	   2004).	   Conceptually,	    making-­‐do	    is	    opposite	    of	    buffering.	    In	    buffering,	    materials	    are	   waiting	    to	    be	    processed,	    whereas	    in	    making-­‐do	    the	    waiting	    time	    of	    one	    of	    the	   material	   or	   input	   is	   actually	   negative,	   i.e.	   processing	   starts	   before	   the	   material	   has	   arrived.	    Here,	    it	    is	    important	    to	    understand	    that	    buffering	    (high	    inventory)	    and	   making-­‐do	    are	    both	    wastes	    and	    as	    such	    are	    utilised	    to	    accommodate	    for	    the	   variability	   in	   production.	   Making-­‐do	   is	   applied	   especially	   in	   circumstances	   where	   there	   is	   a	   demand	   to	   speed	   up	   production	   to	   meet	   deadlines.	    	   As	    such	    making	    do	    comprises	    of	    and	    leads	    to	    several	    other	    wastes	    such	    as	   overproduction,	    movement,	    defects,	    etc.	    However,	    in	    construction	    “making-­‐do”	   manifests	    itself	    into	    a	    significant	    phenomenon	    due	    to	    the	    peculiarities	    of	    the	   construction	   industry	   (Koskela,	   2004).	   Transformation	   View	   is	   the	   main	   reason	   for	   Making-­‐Do:	   As	   discussed	   previously	   in	   Chapter	   2,	   the	   CPM	   method	   of	   production	   planning	   and	   control	   is	   solely	   based	   on	   the	   “T”	   view	   of	   production.	   In	   CPM,	   a	   plan	   consists	   mainly	   of	   a	   Gantt	   chart	   and	   an	   activity	   diagram.	   In	   the	   CPM	   method,	   each	   task	   starts	   when	   the	   master	   schedule	   indicates	   and	   when	   the	   preceding	   activity	   has	   completed.	   However,	   it	   fails	   to	   take	   into	    account	    the	    current	    situation	    on	    site	    and	    also	    the	    other	    flows	    (or	   prerequisites)	   to	   a	   task.	   However,	   as	   main	   focus	   of	   production	   is	   on	   the	   realisation	   of	   tasks,	   little	   attention	   has	   been	   paid	   to	   who,	   when,	   where,	   what	   and	   how	   of	   the	   flow	    activities	    (i.e.	    making	    the	    inputs	    available	    to	    workers).	    To	    deal	    with	    this	   situation	    on	    ground,	    the	    workers	    on	    site	    tend	    to	    find	    “work	    around”	    when	    the	   necessary	   prerequisites	   are	   not	   available,	   resulting	   in	   “making	   do”.	    	   4.1.3	   Effect	   of	   the	   “T”	   view	   on	   Organisational	   Processes	   and	   Technology	   Not	    only	    does	    the	    predominant	    Transformation	    view	    have	    an	    impact	    from	    the	   production	    management	    perspective,	    it	    has	    also	    affected	    other	   supporting/enabling	   processes	   within	   the	   construction	   industry.	   For	   example,	   the	   problem	   of	   “islands	   of	   automation”,	   which	   means	   having	   disparate	   systems	   within	   an	    organisation	    or	    a	    project	    that	    do	    not	    interact/communicate	    well	    with	    each	   other	   and	   do	   not	   support	   integration	   is	   discussed.	   It	   can	   be	   asserted	   that	   this	   due	   to	   the	   predominant	   reliance	   on	   the	   “Transformation”	   view	   of	   production.	   Instead	   of	   addressing	   the	   production	   process	   as	   a	   whole	   and	   also	   catering	   for	   the	   “flow”	   and	    “value”	    aspect	    the	    ICT	    systems,	    organisational	    processes	    and	    organisational	   structures	    (people)	    support	    optimising	    individual	    processes	    and	    neglect	    the	   overall	    production	    management	    efficiency.	    The	    TFV	    perspective	    on	    Processes,	   People	   and	   Technology	   is	   shown	   in	   Table	   6.	   Table	   6.

By	   focussing	   on	   the	   flow	   aspects,	   the	   attention	   is	   towards	   waste	   elimination	   and	   the	   causes	   of	   waste	   (i.e.	   variability	   etc.).	   Koskela	   and	   Howell	   (2002)	   also	   ask	   for	   an	   overhaul	   of	   the	   theory	   of	   management.	   According	   to	   the	   authors	   the	   approach	   of	   management-­‐as-­‐organising	   as	   a	   theory	   of	   planning	    allows	    the	    pull	    type	    of	    production	    control,	    which	    is	    instrumental	    for	   ensuring	   the	   availability	   of	   all	   task	   inputs.	   Also,	   the	   language/action	   perspective,	   as	   a	   theory	   of	   execution,	   focuses	   attention	   to	   commitment	   towards	   the	   plan	   and	   to	   confirmation	   of	   the	   task	   outcome.	    	   At	   the	   practical	   level,	   the	   Last	   Planner	   System™	   satisfies	   most	   requirements	   posed	   by	   the	   above-­‐mentioned	   alternative	   theories,	   such	   as	   management-­‐as-­‐organising,	   focusing	    on	    flow	    and	    language/action	    perspective,	    and	    above	    all	    a	    “pull”	    based	   production	   management	   system.	    	   4.2.1	   The	   Last	   Planner	   System™	   of	   Production	   Planning	   and	   Control	    	   The	   Last	   Planner	   System™	   or	   LPS	   for	   short	   is	   a	   method	   of	   production	   planning	   and	   control	   on	   construction	   sites	   that	   has	   been	   developed	   by	   Ballard	   since	   1992	   in	   the	   USA	   (Ballard,	   2000).	   The	   Last	   Planner™	   system	   has	   been	   successfully	   used	   in	   many	   countries	    and	    has	    contributed	    to	    efficiency	    improvements	    and	    waste	    reduction	   amongst	   other	   benefits.	    	   The	   main	   goal	   of	   the	   LPS	   is	   to	   ensure,	   through	   different	   procedures	   and	   tools,	   that	   all	   the	   preconditions	   of	   a	   task	   are	   satisfied	   when	   it	   is	   started,	   that	   the	   task	   can	   be	   executed	   without	   disturbances,	   and	   that	   it	   is	   completed	   according	   to	   the	   plan.	   The	   share	   of	   tasks	   completed	   as	   planned	   called	   “Percentage	   Plan	   Complete”	   or	   PPC	   for	   short	    is	    monitored	    on	    a	    weekly	    basis.	    The	    reasons	    for	    non-­‐completion	    are	    then	   investigated	   also	   on	   a	   weekly	   basis.	   By	   influencing	   the	   reasons	   found,	   an	   increase	   of	   the	   degree	   of	   realization	   of	   weekly	   plans	   is	   sought.	   One	   further	   element	   of	   the	   Last	   Planner	   method	   is	   rolling	   look-­‐ahead	   planning,	   in	   which	   the	   preconditions	   for	   tasks	   are	   made	   ready	   for	   the	   next	   4-­‐6	   weeks.	   The	   goal	   is	   to	   maintain	   a	   sufficient	   backlog	   of	   ready	   tasks	   (Koskenvesa	   and	   Koskela,	   2005)	   There	   are	   three	   additional	   functions	   of	   the	   Last	   Planner	   system:	   i. Get	   the	   input	   (knowledge)	   from	   all	   stakeholders	   of	   construction	   project	   to	   plan	   ii. Get	   commitment	   from	   the	   stakeholders	   to	   the	   plan	   and	   to	   each	   other	   iii. Increased	   cooperation	   due	   to	   collaborative	   planning	   Koskenvesa	    and	    Koskela	    (2005)	    provide	    an	    explanation	    of	    the	    Last	    Planner	   System.	   The	   observations	   on	   productivity	   of	   a	   construction	   task	   by	   Jaafari	   (1984)	   are	   provided:	   “the	   general	   pattern	   of	   productivity	   of	   a	   construction	   task	   shows	   a	   gradual	    build	    up	    at	    the	    start	    (not	    remaining	    sharp	    as	    anticipated,	    due	    to	   unavailability	   of	   needed	   inputs).	   The	   productivity	   then	   steadily	   rises	   unless	   there	   are	   external	   interruptions.	   Then	   there	   is	   a	   general	   unexplained	   lag/drag	   at	   the	   end	   (10-­‐15%	   unfinished	   task)	   for	   a	   variety	   of	   reasons	   such	   as	   crew	   needed	   elsewhere,	   technical	   problems,	   etc.”	    	   However,	    the	    above	    observation	    does	    not	    corroborate	    with	    the	    CPM	    method	    of	   planning	   and	   control.	   As	   shown	   in	   Figure	   10,	   in	   the	   CPM	   method	   of	   scheduling,	   the	   tasks	   are	   represented	   as	   rectangular	   bars.	   It	   is	   assumed	   that	   there	   will	   be	   sharp	   start	   to	   the	   task,	   uniform	   productivity	   and	   a	   sharp	   end	   with	   no	   tails	   or	   lags.	   In	   most	   cases	   however,	   the	   reality	   is	   closer	   to	   Figure	   11,	   where	   there	   is	   a	   gradual	   rise	   to	   productivity	   in	   the	   beginning	   reaching	   higher	   than	   planned	   (to	   meet	   the	   delay	   at	   start),	   interruptions	   in	   the	   middle	   and	   typically	   a	   tail	   end	   towards	   the	   end.	    	   Figure	   10.

The	    following	    provides	    a	    detailed	    explanation	    of	    the	    Last	    Planner	   System	   and	   its	   key	   features,	   which	   partially	   addresses	   some	   of	   the	   issues	   raised	   above.	    	   4.2.2	   Key	   features	   of	   the	   Last	   Planner	   System	    	   This	    section	    has	    largely	    been	    adapted	    from	    the	    original	    text	    available	    in	    “Lean	   Construction	    Tools	    and	    Techniques”,	    (Ballard	    et	    al.	    2002).	    In	    production	   management,	    planning	    is	    followed	    by	    control.	    In	    traditional	    construction	    this	    is	   mostly	   a	   top-­‐down	   approach	   where	   the	   head-­‐office	   or	   the	   project	   managers	   dictate	   (control)	   what	   needs	   to	   be	   done	   on	   the	   site.	   Whereas	   on	   lean	   projects,	   with	   the	   use	   of	   Last	   Planner	   System,	   the	   site	   team	   which	   is	   in	   charge	   of	   actually	   carrying	   out	   the	   work,	    takes	    part	    in	    the	    planning	    process	    ensuring	    that	    it	    is	    more	    closer	    to	    the	   ground	   situation.	   The	   word	   Last	   Planner	   refers	   to	   the	   Foreman,	   Site	   Manager,	   Shop	   Foreman,	   or	   a	   line	   manager,	   who	   is	   in	   charge	   of	   short-­‐term	   tasks.	    	   • Lookahead	   Planning	   • Weekly	   Planning	   (also	   known	   as	   collaborative	   or	   commitment	   planning)	   • Continuous	   Learning	   (from	   the	   PPC	   and	   reasons	   for	   non-­‐completion)	   The	   main	   rules	   of	   production	   control	   with	   Last	   Planner	   are	   (Ballard	   et	   al.,	   2002):	   • Drop	   activities	   from	   the	   phase	   schedule	   into	   a	   6-­‐week	   (typical)	   look-­‐ahead	   window,	    screen	    for	    constraints,	    and	    advance	    only	    if	    constraints	    can	    be	   removed	   in	   time	   • Try	   to	   make	   only	   quality	   assignments	   –	   require	   that	   defective	   assignments	   be	   rejected	   • Track	   the	   percentage	   of	   assignments	   completed	   each	   plan	   period	   (PPC	   or	   ‘per	   cent	   plan	   complete’)	   and	   act	   on	   reasons	   for	   plan	   failure.	   Ballard	   (2000)	   provides	   a	   workflow	   of	   the	   Last	   Planner	   System	   as	   shown	   in	   Figure	   13.	   	   Figure	    13.	    The	    Last	    Planner	    System	    of	    Production	    Management	    and	    Control	   (Ballard,	   2000).	   4.2.2.1	   Look-­‐ahead	   Planning	   Look-­‐ahead	    planning	    ensures	    that	    there	    is	    a	    sufficient	    number	    of	    mature	    tasks	   available	   to	   be	   performed	   each	   week.	   These	   are	   the	   tasks	   where	   all	   the	   constraints	   have	    been	    removed	    (i.e.	    preconditions	    are	    satisfied).	    Typically	    Look-­‐ahead	   planning	   refers	   to	   planning	   carried	   out	   4-­‐6	   weeks	   in	   advance.	   Look-­‐ahead	   planning	   serves	   the	   following	   key	   functions:	   1. Shape	   the	   workflow	   sequence	   and	   rate	   2. Match	   workflow	   and	   capacity	   3. Maintain	   a	   backlog	   of	   ready	   work	   (workable	   backlog)	   4. Develop	   detailed	   plan	   of	   how	   work	   is	   to	   be	   done	   (operations	   designs)	   The	   key	   tools	   and	   techniques	   involved	   in	   Look-­‐ahead	   planning	   are:	   1. Constraints	   analysis	   2. Activity	   definition	   model	   3. First	   run	   studies	   Constraints	    Analysis:	   The	   main	   focus	   of	   the	   look	   ahead	   planning	   is	   to	   consider	   tasks	   4-­‐6	   weeks	   in	   advance	   and	   identify	   and	   eliminate	   constraints.	   The	   key	   rule	   here	    is	    that	    no	    task	    should	    be	    allowed	    to	    be	    in	    the	    production	    schedule	    if	    the	   planners	   are	   not	   sure	   that	   all	   the	   constraints	   for	   that	   task	   can	   be	   removed	   in	   time.	   This	   forces	   the	   site	   team	   to	   consider	   the	   constraints	   well	   ahead	   in	   time,	   and	   ensure	   only	   mature	   tasks	   for	   production.	   Problems	   such	   as	   labour	   availability	   or	   delivery	   of	    materials	    are	    identified	    early	    and	    dealt	    with.	    This	    reduces	    variability	    and	   improves	   the	   smooth	   flow	   of	   production	   activities.	   There	   is	   a	   slight	   danger	   here	   of	   project	    lagging	    behind	    considerably,	    if	    constraint	    removal	    is	    not	    carried	    out	    in	   systematic	    and	    diligent	    manner.	    For	    example,	    if	    50	    tasks	    are	    considered	    for	    a	   particular	   look	   ahead	   window	   in	   the	   master	   schedule,	   however	   in	   the	   look	   ahead	   plan	   only	   20	   are	   considered	   due	   to	   constraints,	   the	   plan	   reliability	   may	   increase	   locally,	    however	    overall	    project	    might	    lag	    behind.	    It	    is	    up	    to	    the	    project	   supervisor/manager	   to	   ensure	   that	   the	   project	   does	   not	   lag	   behind	   significantly.	    	   Also,	   4-­‐6	   weeks	   window	   is	   an	   ideal	   duration	   for	   look	   ahead	   planning,	   depending	   on	   the	   nature	   of	   the	   project	   and	   organisational	   processes,	   this	   could	   be	   between	   2-­‐6	   weeks.	   The	   longer	   the	   window,	   the	   better	   the	   opportunity	   to	   control	   the	   flow	   of	   work.	   However,	   extending	   the	   window	   too	   much	   in	   advance	   makes	   it	   harder	   for	   the	   work	   crew	   to	   realistically	   plan/predict	   the	   outcome	   of	   constraints	   removal.	   Activity	   Definition	   Model:	   Activity	   Definition	   Model	   (or	   ADM	   for	   short)	   describes	   the	    tasks	    in	    further	    detail	    following	    phase	    planning.	    It	    defines	    tasks	    associated	   constraints,	    work	    methods,	    pre-­‐requisite	    work	    and	    resources.	    Work	    methods	    or	   directives	    describe	    how	    a	    particular	    task	    is	    to	    be	    carried	    out	    or	    assessed.	    For	   example,	    assignments,	    design	    criteria	    and	    contract	    specifications.	    As	    the	    name	   suggests,	    pre-­‐requisite	    work	    are	    the	    previous	    tasks	    or	    components,	    which	    are	   required	    to	    be	    completed	    before	    a	    particular	    task	    can	    be	    started	    (for	    example,	   excavation	    for	    foundation,	    plastering	    before	    painting	    etc.).	    Resources	    are	    simply	   material,	    equipment,	    labour	    or	    work	    conditions.	    Resources	    can	    also	    have	   limitations,	   i.e.	   working	   hours	   for	   labour,	   lifting	   capacity	   for	   crane	   etc.	    	   ADM	   defines	   in	   detail	   how	   activity	   are	   to	   be	   carried	   out	   and	   their	   relations	   with	   each	   other,	   and	   is	   very	   useful	   while	   carrying	   out	   constraints	   analysis.	   First	   Run	   Studies:	   Construction	   is	   kind	   of	   production	   where	   majority	   of	   activities	   are	   carried	   out	   on	   directly	   on	   site	   –	   affected	   by	   external	   conditions,	   as	   opposed	   to	   manufacturing	    where	    production	    happens	    in	    a	    controlled	    environment.	    This	   makes	    construction	    a	    prototype	    kind	    of	    production.	    In	    manufacturing	    several	   prototypes	    are	    produced	    before	    finalising	    on	    a	    single	    product	    and	    also	    the	   production	    method.	    Whereas	    in	    construction,	    often	    work	    begins	    directly	    on	    site	   without	   advance	   consideration	   of	   best	   suitable	   product	   options	   or	   work	   methods.	   Work	   methods	   appear	   simple	   enough	   when	   represented	   in	   the	   estimate,	   but	   that	   design	    is	    seldom	    detailed	    or	    explicit	    at	    the	    step	    or	    sub-­‐cycle	    level.	    Under	    lean	   construction,	   the	   design	   of	   the	   product	   and	   the	   process	   occur	   at	   the	   same	   time	   so	   factors	    affecting	    operations	    are	    considered	    from	    the	    first.	    Ultimately,	    operations	   design	    reaches	    all	    the	    way	    through	    the	    delivery	    system,	    as	    it	    is	    part	    of	    work	   structuring.	    There	    is	    often	    more	    than	    one	    way	    to	    carry	    out	    a	    particular	   construction	   task.	   On	   many	   occasions,	   decisions	   made	   at	   design/conceptual	   stage	   such	    as	    material	    selected	    or	    design	    configuration	    restricts	    the	    choice	    of	    work	   methods.	   Also,	   available	   tools,	   equipment,	   labour	   capacity,	   and	   site	   conditions	   all	   affect	    the	    chosen	    work	    method.	    The	    range	    becomes	    narrower	    as	    the	    work	   progresses	   until	   the	   end	   when	   the	   crew	   decides	   how	   to	   carry	   out	   the	   task	   in	   hand.	   Hence,	   there	   are	   two	   possibilities	   while	   selecting	   work	   methods	   in	   construction;	   one	   is	   to	   leave	   the	   options	   open	   till	   the	   last	   responsible	   moment	   and	   choose	   as	   the	   operation	   progresses.	   Second	   is	   to	   finalise	   the	   work	   method	   and	   plan	   in	   advance	   which	   work	   methods	   to	   use.	   Choosing	   either	   way	   has	   their	   positive	   and	   negative	   factors.	   On	   one	   hand	   having	   flexibility	   till	   last	   moment	   is	   good	   but	   poses	   problems	   while	    planning	    the	    work	    and	    management	    of	    resources	    and	    forecasting;	    on	    the	   other	   hand,	   finalising	   the	   work	   method	   in	   advance	   provides	   stability	   and	   eases	   the	   planning	   and	   forecasting,	   but	   restricts	   the	   work	   method	   ignoring	   developments	   at	   site,	   with	   a	   possibility	   of	   imposing	   an	   inappropriate	   work	   method	   on	   the	   site	   crew.	   Some	   of	   the	   process	   design	   factors	   are	   restricted	   during	   the	   design	   stage,	   however	   many	   operational	   issues	   have	   to	   be	   considered	   during	   the	   production	   stage.	   First	   run	   studies	   help	   the	   production	   crew	   to	   identify	   the	   most	   suitable	   process	   to	   carry	    out	    the	    task	    in	    hand	    by	    considering	    several	    work	    methods	    within	    the	   possible	   range	   of	   options.	   First	   run	   studies	   should	   be	   carried	   out	   3-­‐6	   weeks	   ahead	   of	   starting	   a	   new	   operation.	   They	   are	   more	   important	   for	   unique	   tasks	   where	   the	   site	   team	   has	   inadequate	   previous	   experience.	   First	   run	   studies	   involve	   performing	   the	   operation	   in	   hand	   in	   as	   realistic	   manner	   as	   possible,	   so	   that	   process/product	   issues	    are	    identified,	    resource	    requirements	    are	    known	    and	    skills	    are	    available	   while	   performing	   the	   actual	   operation.	    	   Here,	   the	   use	   of	   virtual	   technology	   can	   assist	   the	   site	   team	   by	   simulating	   the	   task	   on	   the	   digital	   model.	   With	   the	   emergence	   of	   Building	   Information	   Modelling	   (BIM)	   and	   associated	   technologies	   it	   is	   now	   much	   more	   feasible	   to	   simulate	   the	   work	   in	   hand	   beforehand	   along	   with	   visualisation	   of	   work	   process.	   The	   main	   issues	   to	   be	   considered	   from	   the	   point	   of	   view	   of	   first	   run	   studies	   are	   (Ballard	   et	   al.,	   2002):	    	   1. Design	   of	   the	   product	   itself	   2. Available	   technology	   and	   equipment	   3. Site	   layout	   and	   logistics	   4. Size	   of	   work	   packages	   released	   to	   the	   crews	   5. Size	   of	   work	   packages	   released	   to	   downstream	   crews	   6. Potential	   site	   environment	   (temperature,	   precipitation,	   wind,	   etc.)	   7. Safety	   8. Expected	   experience	   and	   skills	   of	   craft	   workers	   and	   supervisors	   9. Craft	   traditions	   or	   union	   work	   rules	   First	   run	   studies	   should	   not	   just	   be	   carried	   out	   for	   repetitive	   tasks	   but	   all	   major	   operations	   should	   be	   considered.	   First	   run	   studies	   help	   shape	   the	   flow	   of	   work	   and	   also	   reduce	   variability.	   Once	   performed	   and	   perfected,	   first	   run	   studies	   help	   design	   the	    optimal	    process,	    which	    eventually	    leads	    to	    standardisation.	    However,	    as	   standardisation	    in	    lean	    construction	    is	    not	    a	    final	    frontier,	    but	    a	    step	    towards	   continual	    improvement,	    the	    process	    should	    be	    revisited	    with	    a	    view	    to	    further	   improvements	   (Ballard	   et	   al.,	   2002).	   4.2.2.2	   Commitment	   planning	   (weekly	   planning)	   In	    the	    LPS,	    weekly	    planning	    is	    one	    of	    the	    most	    important	    activities,	    performed	   collaboratively	    by	    the	    site	    team,	    it	    ensures	    commitment	    from	    all	    parties.	    The	   method	    defines	    criteria	    for	    making	    quality	    assignments	    (Ballard	    and	    Howell,	   1994).	    	   	   The	   quality	   criteria	   proposed	   are:	   • Definition	   • Soundness	   • Sequence	   • Size	   • Learning	   (not,	   strictly	   speaking,	   a	   criterion	   for	   assignments,	   but	   rather	   for	   the	   design	   and	   functioning	   of	   the	   entire	   system)	   The	   look-­‐ahead	   planning	   process	   ensures	   that	   only	   those	   tasks	   are	   considered	   for	   execution	   where	   the	   constraints	   have	   been	   removed.	   The	   weekly	   planning	   process	   ensures	   commitment	   from	   all	   stakeholders	   and	   considers	   coordination	   issues.	   This	   improves	   collaboration	   between	   stakeholders	   as	   they	   directly	   communicate	   with	   each	    other	    and	    minimises	    disruption	    during	    execution.	    In	    the	    end,	    arguably	    the	   most	   prevailing	   waste	   in	   construction	   –	   “making	   do”	   is	   minimised.	    	   In	    contrast	    to	    the	    traditional	    planning	    process	    where	    each	    construction	    team	   (subcontractor)	    plans	    their	    own	    work,	    the	    Last	    Planner	    Process	    requires	    all	   subcontractors	   to	   attend	   the	   collaborative	   weekly	   planning	   session.	   This	   ensures	   that	    any	    coordination	    issues	    arising	    during	    the	    planning	    are	    resolved	    directly,	   while	    also	    ensuring	    commitment	    of	    each	    stakeholder	    directly	    to	    the	    team.	    This	   increases	   trust	   within	   the	   team	   and	   ensures	   smooth	   running	   of	   the	   project.	   During	   the	   weekly	   planning	   sessions,	   the	   site	   team	   also	   analyses	   past	   week’s	   performance	   and	   measures	   it	   in	   terms	   of	   “Percentage	   Plan	   Complete”	   or	   PPC	   in	   short.	   Reasons	   for	   non-­‐completion	   of	   tasks	   are	   also	   noted	   and	   analysed	   so	   that	   problems	   can	   be	   avoided	    in	    future.	    It	    is	    expected	    that	    gradually	    increasing	    or	    steady	    PPC	    means	   good	    productivity	    levels	    are	    being	    achieved,	    where	    as	    sharp	    rise	    or	    dips	    in	    PPC	   indicate	   production	   related	   problems.	   Also,	   increasing	   PPC	   not	   only	   leads	   to	   better	   performance	   of	   the	   execution	   team	   but	   also	   for	   subsequent	   teams,	   as	   they	   can	   start	   work	   as	   planned	   and	   so	   on.	    	   The	    Last	    Planner	    considers	    those	    quality	    criteria	    in	    advance	    of	    committing	   production	   units	   to	   doing	   work	   in	   order	   to	   shield	   these	   units	   from	   uncertainty.	   The	   plan’s	   success	   at	   reliably	   forecasting	   what	   work	   will	   get	   accomplished	   by	   the	   end	   of	   the	   week	   is	   measured	   in	   terms	   of	   the	   PPC.	   Root	   causes	   for	   plan	   failure	   are	   then	   identified	   and	   attacked,	   so	   that	   future	   problems	   may	   be	   avoided.	   This	   is	   in	   contrast	   to	   the	   usual	   “fire-­‐fighting”	   situation	   where	   the	   site	   team	   is	   always	   aspiring	   to	   reach	   the	   production	   targets	   set	   out	   in	   the	   master	   plan	   and	   not	   performing	   in	   optimal	   conditions.	    	    	   4.2.2.3	   Learning	   (reasons	   analysis	   and	   action)	   In	   LPS,	   each	   week	   last	   week’s	   plan	   is	   measured	   and	   analysed,	   and	   reasons	   for	   non	   performance	   have	   to	   be	   provided	   by	   each	   team.	   These	   are	   then	   analysed	   and	   the	   root	    cause	    of	    the	    problem	    is	    identified.	    This	    helps	    the	    site	    team	    to	    learn	    from	   mistakes	   so	   that	   they	   can	   be	   avoided	   in	   future.	   There	   could	   be	   various	   causes	   for	   non-­‐completion,	    i.e.	    look-­‐ahead	    plan	    not	    accurate,	    misjudgement	    by	    the	    last	   planner,	    late	    delivery	    by	    a	    supplier,	    or	    labour	    unavailability.	    In	    either	    case	   improvement	   must	   be	   sought	   and	   continual	   failure	   in	   the	   same	   category	   must	   be	   escalated	   and	   resolved.	   Carrying	   out	   this	   analysis	   and	   improvement	   activities	   also	   improves	    organisational	    learning	    and	    knowledge	    management	    practices.	    Teams	   retain	   knowledge	   on	   subsequent	   projects	   regarding	   this	   process	   and	   also	   common	   causes	   for	   failure	   leading	   to	   better	   performance.	    	   4.2.3	   Visual	   Management	   and	   other	   lean	   tools	   Lean	   construction	   uses	   a	   range	   of	   tools	   and	   techniques	   to	   support	   the	   production	   management	    and	    other	    processes.	    Tools	    such	    as	    KanBan,	    Andon,	    5S	    are	    well	   known	    and	    used	    regularly	    in	    lean	    production.	    Some	    of	    these	    tools	    are	    part	    of	    a	   management	    technique	    called	    Visual	    Management,	    use	    of	    which	    is	    increasing	    in	   construction	   (Tezel,	   2011).	   Visual	   Management	   can	   be	   defined	   as	   a	   management	   system	   that	   attempts	   to	   improve	   organisational	   performance	   through	   connecting	   and	    aligning	    organisational	    vision,	    core	    values,	    goals	    and	    culture	    by	    means	    of	   stimuli,	    which	    directly	    address	    one	    or	    more	    of	    the	    five	    human	    senses	    (sight,	   hearing,	   feeling,	   smell	   and	   taste)	   (Liff	   and	   Posey,	   2004).	   There	   are	   many	   forms	   of	   Visual	   Management	   devices	   or	   tools	   that	   are	   used	   routinely,	   such	   as	   notice	   boards,	   road	   signs,	   safety	   and	   other	   symbols,	   etc.	   The	   main	   objective	   of	   these	   visual	   aids	   is	   to	    make	    communication	    simple,	    attractive	    and	    efficient	    (Tezel,	    2011).	    From	   production	   management	   perspective,	   Visual	   Management	   can	   also	   be	   considered	   as	    a	    communication/information	    strategy	    that	    uses	    visual	    communication	    to	   (Tezel,	   2011):	   • Increase	   autonomy	   (self-­‐management)	   of	   the	   workplace	   • Reduce	   waste,	   overburden	   and	   unevenness	   • Increase	    transparency	    and	    pervasive	    information	    availability	    at	    the	   workplace	   • Remove	   blockages	   of	   information	   There	   are	   a	   number	   of	   Visual	   Management	   functions	   that	   help	   service	   production	   management	   in	   construction	   (Tezel,	   2011),	   including:	   • Visual	   order	   • Visual	   standards	   • Visual	   measures	   • Visual	   controls	   • Visual	   guarantees	   Some	   examples	   of	   these	   functions	   are	   provided	   in	   Table	   7.	   As	   can	   be	   seen	   from	   the	   examples,	    the	    “Visual	    Order”	    function	    supports	    the	    work	    place	    organisation	   method	   5S	   (Tezel,	   2011).

The	    main	    function	    is	    to	   communicate	    the	    process	    requirements	    to	    achieve	    desired	    behaviour	    from	   workers.	    In	    construction,	    these	    can	    be	    posters	    regarding	    worker	    safety,	    or	   common	   work	   processes	   being	   explained	   in	   form	   of	   a	   flow	   chart	   etc.	   The	    Visual	    Measures	    promote	    transparency	    of	    information	    by	    being	    open	    to	   everyone	    and	    easy	    to	    understand.	    However,	    at	    the	    same	    time	    they	    try	    to	    avoid	   information	    overload.	    One	    of	    the	    examples	    in	    lean	    construction	    is	    a	    PPC	   (percentage	    plan	    complete)	    measure	    of	    last	    planner	    or	    the	    pie	    chart	    depicting	   reasons	    for	    non-­‐completion.	    In	    the	    examples,	    the	    second	    photograph	    shows	   individual	   PPC	   of	   the	   subcontractors.	   The	   Visual	   Controls	   are	   one	   of	   the	   most	   important	   functions	   of	   Visual	   Management,	   and	   they	   help	   control	   the	   aspects	   of	   production	   in	   a	   highly	   effective	   and	   visual	   way.	   The	   first	   example	   in	   Table	   7	   shows	   a	   visual	   KanBan,	   which	   helps	   workers	   visually	   identify	   the	   level	   of	   stock	   available	   and	   when	   to	   order	   new	   material.	   The	   second	   example	    shows	    a	    Heijunka	    box,	    which	    is	    used	    to	    control	    production	    rates	    of	   equipment	   such	   as	   concrete	   mixers.	   The	   workers	   use	   the	   Heijunka	   box	   to	   indicate	   the	   type	   of	   concrete	   mix,	   quantity	   and	   the	   time	   at	   which	   it	   is	   required	   by	   placing	   a	   card	   in	   the	   appropriate	   slot	   the	   day	   before.	   The	   mixer	   operator	   then	   uses	   the	   cards	   to	   plan	   concrete	   production	   and	   places	   the	   cards	   in	   the	   bucket	   so	   that	   transporting	   workers	   can	   easily	   identify	   where	   to	   take	   the	   concrete.	   The	   third	   example	   shows	   an	   “Andon”	   board,	   which	   shows	   the	   status	   of	   production	   at	   any	   given	   point	   in	   time	   at	    various	    locations	    on	    site.	    The	    locations	    to	    be	    monitored	    include	    buttons	    to	   indicate	   the	   current	   status	   of	   production,	   and	   are	   colour	   coded	   (green,	   amber	   and	   red),	   while	   the	   Andon	   board	   is	   placed	   in	   the	   site	   manager’s	   cabin.	   If	   the	   workers	   anticipate	   a	   problem,	   they	   press	   the	   yellow	   button,	   which	   changes	   the	   light	   for	   that	   location	   on	   the	   Andon	   board.	   This	   helps	   the	   site	   manager	   (or	   foreman)	   to	   respond	   to	   the	   problem	   quickly.	   If	   the	   work	   is	   stopped	   the	   red	   button	   is	   pressed,	   indicating	   the	   urgency	   of	   the	   problem.	   The	   Andon	   boards	   also	   support	   the	   lean	   concept	   of	   worker	   empowerment,	   by	   giving	   them	   partial	   control	   of	   the	   production	   process.	   Finally,	    the	    Visual	    Guarantees	    are	    meant	    to	    “mistake	    proof”	    a	    function,	    by	   guaranteeing	   the	   desired	   outcome	   through	   a	   simple	   physical	   or	   electrical	   redesign	   of	   the	   process,	   and	   is	   a	   least	   developed	   area	   of	   Visual	   Management	   in	   construction	   (Tezel,	   2011).	   The	   example	   in	   Table	   7	   show	   the	   nails	   being	   used	   to	   prevent	   the	   pipe	   heads	   from	   shifting	   during	   installation.	   Table	   7.

Lean	   construction	   principles	   address	   all	   three	   “TFV”	   aspects	   and	    have	    a	    range	    of	    tools	    and	    techniques	    to	    support	    the	    construction	    process.	   Application	   of	   such	   lean	   tools	   and	   techniques	   in	   construction	   has	   brought	   positive	   results	    and	    is	    now	    being	    followed	    by	    a	    number	    of	    construction	    organisations	   internationally.	   One	    of	    the	    most	    popular	    lean	    construction	    tool,	    The	    Last	    Planner	    System™	   addresses	    some	    of	    the	    problems	    of	    the	    production	    management,	    which	    were	   outlined	   in	   Chapter	   3.	   It	   helps	   create	   a	   collaborative	   environment	   and	   improves	   flow	   of	   the	   production	   process,	   and	   reduces	   variability	   and	   improving	   certainty	   at	   the	   same	   time.	   In	   general,	   tasks	   can	   be	   started	   and	   completed	   as	   planned	   due	   to	   being	    free	    of	    constraints,	    and	    there	    is	    an	    environment	    of	    trust	    between	   subcontractors	   due	   to	   the	   element	   of	   commitment	   planning	   integrated	   within	   the	   system.	    The	    Last	    Planner	    System™	    serves	    as	    a	    capable	    entry	    point	    into	    Lean	   Construction	    techniques	    and	    is	    being	    successfully	    implemented	    across	    many	   projects	    ever	    since	    it	    was	    developed	    (Kemmer	    et	    al.,	    2010;	    Kalsaas	    et	    al.,	    2009;	   Salem	   et	   al.,	   2005).	   However,	   it	   only	   partially	   addresses	   the	   production	   management	   problems,	   as	   it	   does	    not	    address	    the	    product	    management	    aspect	    of	    construction.	    Some	    of	    the	   problems	   related	   to	   product	   management	   aspect	   in	   construction	   are	   addressed	   by	   Building	   Information	   Modelling,	   which	   is	   discussed	   in	   the	   following	   section.	    	   4.3	   Building	   Information	   Modelling	   While	   Lean	   Construction	   addresses	   some	   of	   the	   problems	   related	   to	   process	   and	   production	   management	   of	   construction	   projects,	   Building	   Information	   Modelling	   (commonly	   known	   as	   BIM)	   addresses	   some	   core	   problems	   related	   to	   the	   product	   modelling,	   process	   modelling	   and	   product	   and	   process	   visualisation.	   It	   also	   has	   a	   potential	    to	    act	    as	    a	    central	    information	    management	    platform	    that	    could	    help	   synchronise	   and	   visualise	   production	   related	   information	   throughout	   the	   project.	   This	    section	    describes	    what	    is	    (and	    is	    not)	    BIM,	    what	    are	    its	    main	    benefits	   throughout	    the	    construction	    lifecycle	    and	    specifically	    its	    potential	    to	    address	   production	   management	   goals.	   4.3.1	   A	   brief	   history	   of	   BIM	   In	    recent	    years,	    BIM	    has	    emerged	    as	    one	    of	    the	    most	    important	    technological	   platform	    in	    the	    construction	    industry	    (Sacks	    et	    al.,	    2010,	    Eastman	    et	    al.,	    2007).	   However,	   its	   origins	   can	   be	   traced	   back	   as	   far	   back	   as	   1975	   when	   Eastman	   wrote	   an	    article	    in	    the	    AIA	    journal	    about	    the	    working	    prototype	    “Building	    Description	   System”.	    In	    the	    same	    period	    (1970s	    and	    1980s)	    the	    early	    commercial	    systems	   around	    the	    concept	    started	    to	    emerge.	    The	    RUCAPS	    system	    by	    GMW	    computers	   was	    developed	    around	    this	    same	    technology.	    In	    a	    paper,	    Aish	    (1986)	    described	   now	    commonly	    known	    features	    such	    as	    3D	    modelling,	    Automatic	    Drawing	   Generation,	    intelligent	    and	    parametric	    components	    and	    temporal	    planning	    of	   construction	   processes	   etc.	   The	    term	    Building	    Information	    Model	    was	    first	    coined	    by	    van	    Nederveen	    and	   Tolman	    (1992).	    From	    commercial	    viewpoint	    as	    well,	    a	    number	    of	    technological	   companies	   have	   been	   developing	   products	   since	   mind	   1980s	   that	   support	   the	   BIM	   functions	   that	   are	   popular	   today.	   Hence	   at	   least	   three	   decades	   of	   refinement	   and	   development	   has	   taken	   place	   to	   reach	   a	   stage	   where	   the	   BIM	   technology	   is	   now.	   4.3.2	   What	   is	   BIM	   There	    are	    many	    definitions	    of	    BIM;	    Building	    Information	    Model,	    Building	   Information	   Modelling	   and	   Building	   Information	   Management.	   The	   BIM	   handbook	   (Eastman	   et	   al.	   2011)	   defines	   BIM	   as	   “a	   verb	   or	   adjective	   phrase	   to	   describe	   tools,	   processes,	    and	    technologies	    that	    are	    facilitated	    by	    digital	    machine-­‐readable	   documentation	    about	    a	    building,	    its	    performance,	    its	    planning,	    its	    construction,	   and	    later	    its	    operation”.	    The	    whole	    process	    could	    also	    be	    described	    as	    Building	   Information	   Modelling	   and	   Management,	   sometimes	   also	   abbreviated	   "BIMM".	   The	   result	    of	    BIM	    activity	    is	    a	    “Building	    Information	    Model.”	    BIM	    software	    tools	    are	   characterized	   by	   the	   ability	   to	   compile	   virtual	   models	   of	   buildings	   using	   computer-­readable	    objects	    that	    include	    characteristics	    and	    behaviour	    which	    enable	   designing,	   analysing,	   and	   testing	   of	   building	   design	   and	   lifecycle	   properties	   (Sacks	   et	   al.	   2004).	    	   In	   simple	   terms	   BIM	   models	   (Eastman	   et	   al.,	   2011):	   i. Are	    accurate	    virtual	    representations	    of	    the	    physical	    world	    (building	    or	   other	   construction	   artefact)	   which	   can	   include	   also	   information	   of	   process,	   schedule,	    maintenance	    etc.	    (construction	    project	    and	    operation	    &	   maintenance)	   ii. Consist	    of	    objects	    (parts	    of	    the	    building/structure)	    that	    demonstrate	   intelligent	   and	   parametric	   behaviour.	   For	   example	   if	   a	   door	   is	   considered	   as	   an	   object	   in	   the	   model,	   it	   can	   have	   the	   following	   properties	   a. Material:	   Wood,	   glass,	   metal	   etc.	   b. Type	   of	   door:	   Double	   or	   single,	   Internal	   or	   external,	   sliding	   or	   hinged	   c. Connection	   to	   other	   objects:	   Typically	   wall	   d. Other	    properties:	    Minimum	    height/width,	    opening	    direction,	    lock	   and	    other	    hardware,	    safety/security	    requirements,	    fire	    protection	   etc.	   e. Detailed	   product	   information:	   Manufacturer,	   type,	   individual	   ID,	   etc.	   iii. Can	    interact	    with	    other	    construction	    information	    systems	    including	    other	   BIM	   systems	   a. For	   example,	   estimating	   system	   can	   read	   the	   information	   contained	   within	    the	    model	    to	    fully	    or	    partly	    automate	    the	    Bill	    of	    Quantity	   extraction	   resulting	   in	   saved	   time	   and	   increased	   accuracy.	   b. The	    procurement	    system	    can	    link	    to	    the	    model	    to	    read	    the	   scheduling	   and	   supplier	   data	   for	   fully	   or	   partly	   automated	   ordering	   process	   c. The	   Facility	   management/maintenance	   system	   can	   be	   linked	   to	   the	   model	    to	    provide	    period	    maintenance	    data,	    manufacturing	   information	    and	    other	    operational	    information	    about	    the	    objects	   within	   the	   model.	   The	    above-­‐mentioned	    characteristics	    of	    BIM	    are	    largely	    due	    to	    its	    parametric	   nature	    (or	    the	    parametric	    nature	    of	    the	    objects	    it	    contains).	    The	    concept	    of	    the	   parametric	    objects	    is	    core	    to	    BIM	    technologies	    and	    differentiates	    BIM	    from	   traditional	   2D	   or	   3D	   CAD	   technologies.	   Parametric	   objects	   are	   defined	   as	   (Eastman	   et	   al.,	   2011):	   • Consisting	   of	   geometric	   definitions	   and	   associated	   data	   and	   rules	   • The	   geometry	   of	   the	   objects	   is	   integrated	   non-­‐redundantly,	   and	   allows	   for	   no	    inconsistencies.	    When	    an	    object	    is	    shown	    in	    3D,	    the	    shape	    cannot	    be	   represented	    internally	    redundantly,	    for	    example,	    as	    multiple	    2D	    views.	    A	   plan	   and	   elevation	   of	   a	   given	   object	   must	   always	   be	   consistent.	   Dimensions	   cannot	   be	   “fudged”.	   • Objects	    have	    parametric	    rules,	    which	    automatically	    modify	    associated	   geometries	   when	   inserted	   into	   a	   building	   model	   or	   when	   changes	   are	   made	   to	   associated	   objects.	   For	   example,	   a	   door	   will	   fit	   automatically	   into	   a	   wall,	   a	   light	   switch	   will	   automatically	   locate	   next	   to	   the	   proper	   side	   of	   the	   door,	   a	   wall	   will	   automatically	   resize	   itself	   to	   butt	   to	   a	   ceiling	   or	   roof	   and	   so	   on.	   • Objects	   can	   be	   defined	   at	   different	   levels	   of	   aggregation,	   so	   a	   wall	   can	   be	   defined	    as	    well	    as	    its	    related	    components.	    Objects	    can	    be	    defined	    and	   managed	   at	   any	   number	   of	   hierarchy	   levels.	   For	   example,	   if	   the	   weight	   of	   a	   wall	   subcomponent	   changes,	   the	   weight	   of	   the	   wall	   should	   also	   change.	   • Objects’	    rules	    can	    identify	    when	    a	    particular	    change	    violates	    object	   feasibility	   regarding	   size,	   manufacturability,	   and	   so	   on.	   • Objects	    have	    the	    ability	    to	    link	    to	    or	    receive,	    broadcast,	    or	    export	    sets	    of	   attributes,	   for	   example,	   structural	   materials,	   acoustic	   data,	   energy	   data,	   and	   the	   like,	   to	   other	   applications	   and	   models.	   4.3.3	   What	   is	   not	   BIM	    	   A	   number	   of	   misconceptions	   exist	   about	   BIM	   due	   to	   its	   complex	   and	   broad	   nature.	   For	    example,	    in	    some	    instances	    “3D	    CAD”	    generated	    for	    simple	    visualisation	   purposes	    but	    without	    accurate	    parametric	    intelligence	    and	    information	    about	   objects	   within	   the	   model,	   is	   misunderstood	   as	   BIM.	   Such	   three-­‐dimensional	   (3D)	   computer-­‐aided	    drafting	    (CAD)	    models	    that	    do	    not	    consist	    of	    objects,	    including	   form,	    function,	    and	    behaviour	    (Tolman,	    1999)	    cannot	    be	    considered	    building	   information	   models.	   It	    is	    also	    important	    to	    understand	    that	    BIM	    is	    simply	    not	    just	    a	    technological	   platform	   or	   a	   tool	   that	   is	   used	   only	   by	   a	   small	   group	   of	   users	   on	   a	   project.	   BIM	   in	   fact	   provides	   “the	   basis	   for	   new	   construction	   capabilities	   and	   changes	   in	   the	   roles	   and	   relationships	   among	   a	   project	   team.	    	    When	   implemented	   appropriately,	   BIM	   facilitates	   a	   more	   integrated	   design	   and	   construction	   process	   that	   results	   in	   better	   quality	    buildings	    at	    lower	    cost	    and	    reduced	    project	    duration.”	    (Eastman	    et	    al.,	   2010)	    	    In	   this	   sense,	   BIM	   is	   expected	   to	   provide	   the	   foundation	   for	   some	   of	   the	   results	   that	   Lean	   Construction	   is	   expected	   to	   deliver.	   4.4	   Benefits	   of	   BIM	   The	    benefits	    of	    the	    BIM	    technologies	    span	    the	    entire	    building/construction	   lifecycle	    starting	    from	    the	    conceptual	    design/feasibility	    stage	    to	    handover	    and	   facility	   maintenance	   stage	   or	   even	   up	   to	   the	   decommissioning	   or	   demolition	   of	   the	   building.	   The	   following	   section	   summarises	   the	   most	   common	   benefits	   of	   BIM	   at	   various	   stages	   of	   the	   construction	   project	   (Eastman	   et	   al.,	   2011).	   4.4.1	   Pre-­‐construction/Feasibility	   Study	   At	   this	   stage	   the	   main	   goal	   is	   to	   understand	   whether	   the	   desired	   functions	   from	   a	   building	   or	   a	   structure	   can	   be	   realised	   within	   the	   available	   budget	   and	   time.	   BIM	   provides	    a	    platform	    to	    visually	    appraise	    the	    spatial	    requirements	    and	    rapidly	   quantify	   the	   cost	   and	   time	   aspects	   of	   the	   project	   by	   linking	   it	   with	   the	   cost	   data	   in	   a	   parametric	   way.	   Specifically	   the	   following	   benefits	   are	   realised:	   4.4.1.1	   Improving	   programme	   certainty	   through	   spatial	   analysis	    	   There	    are	    tools	    available	    to	    automatically	    check	    models	    against	    spatial	   requirements,	   for	   example	   minimum	   size	   of	   a	   particular	   type	   of	   room,	   minimum	   height	   of	   a	   door	   or	   distance	   between	   the	   wall	   an	   opening	   (such	   as	   a	   window).	   By	   automating	   such	   tasks,	   the	   quality	   and	   speed	   of	   design	   improves	   greatly.	    	   4.4.1.2	   Rapidly	   consider	   and	   explore	   design	   alternatives	   By	    linking	    the	    parametric	    BIM	    model	    to	    cost	    estimating	    and	    energy	    analysis	   systems,	    it	    is	    possible	    to	    rapidly	    evaluate	    design	    alternatives	    to	    analyse	    the	   performance	   of	   the	   facility	   from	   cost,	   time	   and	   performance	   perspective.	    	   4.4.1.3	   Receive	   early	   feedback	   from	   downstream	   players	   through	   programme	   simulation	    	   By	    linking	    a	    high	    level	    project	    plan	    even	    during	    the	    feasibility	    study/concept	   development	   stage	   and	   developing	   a	   4D	   model,	   a	   significant	   amount	   of	   variability	   can	   be	   reduced	   by	   carrying	   out	   a	   constructability	   review.	   Having	   a	   4D	   simulation	   done	   early	   on	   a	   project	   where	   new	   construction	   or	   refurbishment	   is	   taking	   place	   side-­‐by-­‐side	    an	    operational	    building	    can	    also	    help	    identify	    the	    impact	    of	   construction	   activities	   on	   building	   operation.	   4.4.2	   Design	   and	   Detail	   4.4.2.1	   More	   accurate	   early	   visualisation	   of	   design	   With	    earlier	    3D	    (non	    BIM)	    technologies	    where	    geometric	    models	    were	    created	   with	    non-­‐parametric	    technologies,	    significant	    time	    and	    effort	    was	    required	    to	   generate	    such	    visualisations	    and	    on	    many	    occasions	    they	    were	    not	    accurate.	   However,	    with	    the	    advent	    of	    BIM	    technologies,	    it	    is	    now	    possible	    to	    visualise	   design	    at	    any	    stage	    with	    accurately	    reflects	    what	    has	    been	    designed.	    This	    is	   significant	   especially	   at	   early	   stages	   to	   capture	   the	   design	   intent	   from	   client	   and	   to	   communicate	   to	   key	   stakeholders.	   4.4.2.2	   Automatic	   propagation	   of	   design	   changes	   Design	   is	   an	   iterative	   process	   and	   changes	   are	   made	   constantly,	   especially	   when	   design	   from	   various	   sources	   have	   to	   be	   synchronised	   (i.e.	   structural,	   architectural,	   MEP).	   With	   BIM,	   it	   is	   now	   possible	   to	   control	   and	   link	   the	   object	   properties	   in	   a	   parametric	   way,	   and	   hence	   changes	   made	   to	   one	   object/element	   ensures	   that	   all	   connected	   objects	   change	   their	   properties	   in	   a	   parametric	   way.	   4.4.2.3	   Generating	   accurate	   drawings	   automatically	    	   Even	   with	   BIM,	   it	   is	   necessary	   to	   generate	   and	   distribute	   2D	   drawings	   at	   certain	   stages.	   However,	   drawing	   generation	   from	   majority	   of	   BIM	   system	   is	   an	   automatic	   process	   and	   drawings	   always	   correspond	   to	   the	   current	   model	   ensuring	   accuracy.	   4.4.2.4	   Better	   collaboration	   between	   designers	   Synchronising	   design	   early	   ensures	   minimal	   rework	   and	   improved	   accuracy	   and	   quality	    of	    design.	    With	    BIM	    it	    is	    possible	    to	    regularly	    synchronise	    design	    and	   perform	   tasks	   such	   as	   clash	   detection.	   This	   ensures	   that	   design	   is	   error	   free	   and	   any	   constructability	   or	   performance	   issues	   are	   identified	   early.	   4.4.2.5	   Linking	   design	   to	   cost	   estimates	   Many	    design	    decisions	    are	    linked	    to	    the	    cost,	    and	    the	    possibility	    to	    generate	   automatic	    cost	    estimates	    based	    on	    the	    BIM	    model	    at	    any	    stage	    during	    design	   enables	    to	    client	    to	    make	    better	    informed	    decision.	    It	    can	    also	    help	    during	    the	   bidding/tendering	   stage	   to	   provide	   an	   accurate	   bill	   of	   quantities	   to	   all	   bidders.	   4.4.2.6	   Improving	   Performance	   of	   the	   Facility	   BIM	   enables	   carrying	   out	   sophisticated	   simulation	   such	   as	   acoustics,	   energy	   and	   lighting	   during	   the	   design	   stage.	   Again,	   this	   enables	   the	   client	   to	   make	   informed	   decisions	    and	    makes	    sure	    the	    facility	    performs	    to	    the	    requirements.	    With	   government	   imposing	   stringent	   guidelines	   with	   carbon	   emissions,	   it	   helps	   achieve	   those	   targets	   and	   improves	   sustainability.	    	   4.4.3	   Construction	   4.4.3.1	   Performing	   clash	   detection	    	   With	   BIM	   it	   is	   possible	   to	   synchronise	   design	   models	   from	   all	   disciplines	   before	   construction	    begins	    (and	    also	    during	    construction	    when	    design	    is	    going	    on	    in	   parallel)	    to	    identify	    any	    hard	    (physical)	    or	    soft	    (tolerance)	    clashes	    between	   elements.	   This	   ensures	   that	   these	   issues	   do	   not	   delay	   the	   construction	   process	   and	   also	   minimises	   rework	   if	   the	   clashes	   are	   found	   after	   construction	   has	   taken	   place.	    	   4.4.3.2	   Using	   4D/5D	   for	   production	   planning	   When	   a	   project	   plan	   is	   linked	   to	   a	   BIM	   model,	   the	   combined	   model	   is	   called	   4D.	   When	   cost	   and	   quantity	   information	   is	   linked	   to	   such	   a	   model	   the	   model	   is	   called	   a	   5D	    model.	    Such	    4D	    and	    5D	    models	    can	    help	    contractors	    understand	    how	    a	   construction	    project	    will	    look	    like	    at	    any	    given	    point	    in	    time.	    This	    functionality	   greatly	   depends	   on	   the	   level	   of	   detail	   the	   model	   is	   based	   upon	   and	   may	   vary	   if	   the	   temporary	   structures	   are	   not	   included	   and	   if	   the	   plan	   is	   only	   at	   a	   high	   level	   (i.e.	   a	   master	   plan).	   4.4.3.3	   Prefabrication	   with	   BIM	   With	   BIM	   the	   geometric	   data	   is	   accurately	   represented	   and	   this	   enables	   building	   components	    to	    be	    sent	    directly	    for	    automated	    fabrication	    using	    numerically	   controlled	    machines.	    Steel	    fabricated	    components,	    precast	    concrete	    elements,	   fenestration	    and	    glass	    fabrication	    are	    already	    manufactured	    on	    construction	   projects	   using	   this	   method.	   Offsite	   construction	   is	   proven	   to	   improve	   construction	   quality	   and	   is	   promoted	   in	   the	   UK	   by	   the	   Government.	   4.4.3.4	   Integrating	   supporting	   systems	   with	   BIM	   Construction	    is	    a	    complex	    process	    and	    many	    information	    systems	    related	    to	   supporting	   activities	   such	   as	   safety,	   quality,	   procurement	   and	   logistics	   are	   used	   on	   a	   typical	   construction	   process.	   All	   of	   these	   systems	   share	   a	   common	   data	   model	   –	   that	   of	   the	   construction	   facility.	   BIM	   can	   provide	   a	   common	   platform	   to	   facilitate	   efficient	   functioning	   of	   these	   systems.	    	   4.4.4	   Fit-­‐out	   and	   Handover	   4.4.4.1	   Visual	   feedback	   during	   fit-­‐out	   operations	    	   During	   the	   fit-­‐out	   operations,	   a	   significant	   number	   of	   parallel	   activities	   are	   going	   on.	   The	   fit-­‐out	   process	   can	   become	   quite	   complex	   especially	   for	   projects	   such	   as	   hospital	   buildings	   where	   specialist	   machines	   have	   to	   be	   installed,	   linked	   and	   tested	   before	   handing	   over	   the	   facility	   to	   the	   owner.	   In	   such	   situations,	   visually	   keeping	   a	   track	   of	   the	   progress	   can	   be	   quite	   useful	   to	   ensure	   efficient	   operation.	   BIM	   can	   be	   used	   to	   provide	   a	   visual	   workflow	   for	   tasks	   such	   as	   –	   arrival,	   testing,	   installation	   and	    sign-­‐off	    of	    equipment	    and	    systems	    for	    construction	    projects.	    Tasks	    at	    a	   different	    stage	    in	    the	    workflow	    can	    be	    coloured	    differently	    in	    BIM	    to	    visually	   provide	   a	   feedback	   to	   the	   project	   manager.	    	   4.4.4.2	   Digital	   handover	   with	   accurate	   as-­‐built	   model	   With	   BIM	   it	   is	   possible	   to	   use	   technologies	   such	   as	   laser	   scanning	   to	   first	   compare	   the	   actual	   construction	   with	   design	   model	   and	   then	   to	   provide	   an	   accurate	   as-­‐built	   model	   of	   the	   facility.	   Laser	   scanners	   provide	   a	   “point	   cloud”	   of	   the	   3D	   geometry,	   which	   can	   be	   imported	   in	   many	   popular	   BIM	   systems	   to	   then	   develop	   a	   surface	   model	   that	   can	   be	   overlapped	   on	   top	   of	   the	   design	   model	   to	   make	   comparisons.	    	   Also,	    during	    the	    handover	    stage	    it	    is	    also	    possible	    for	    the	    contractor	    and	   subcontractors	    to	    capture	    accurate	    information	    about	    the	    building	    from	   operational	   perspective.	   For	   example,	   information	   regarding	   important	   assets	   such	   as	    manufacturing	    data,	    operational	    and	    performance	    data	    and	    service	    related	   information	   could	   be	   captured	   for	   a	   digital	   hand-­‐over	   to	   the	   client.	   4.4.5	   Operation	   and	   Maintenance	   An	    accurate	    as-­‐built	    model	    that	    carries	    up-­‐to-­‐date	    information	    about	    a	    facility’s	   assets	   and	   its	   operational	   data	   can	   be	   extremely	   useful	   to	   the	   FM	   team.	   This	   has	   been	   demonstrated	   by	   the	   Maryland	   General	   Hospital	   case	   study	   (Eastman	   et	   al.,	   2011).	    When	    the	    Facilities	    Management	    system	    is	    integrated	    with	    the	    Building	   Information	    Model,	    the	    operatives	    can	    refer	    to	    hidden	    objects	    (behind	    the	   structure)	   and	   bring	   up	   relevant	   information	   to	   reduce	   time	   taken	   to	   respond	   to	   a	   call.	   4.4.6	   Summary	   BIM	   can	   be	   seen	   not	   only	   as	   a	   technology	   or	   a	   set	   of	   technological	   tools,	   but	   as	   a	   process	    change	    that	    supports	    the	    entire	    lifecycle	    of	    the	    construction	    project.	    It	   provides	   the	   basis	   for	   new	   design	   and	   construction	   capabilities	   and	   changes	   in	   the	   roles	   and	   relationships	   among	   a	   project	   team.	   When	   adopted	   well,	   BIM	   facilitates	   a	   more	    integrated	    design	    and	    construction	    process	    that	    results	    in	    better	    quality	   buildings	   at	   lower	   cost	   and	   reduced	   project	   duration.	   (Eastman	   et	   al.,	   2011).	   4.5	   The	   integration	   of	   Lean	   and	   BIM	   4.5.1	   Introduction	   As	   discussed	   separately,	   lean	   construction	   and	   Building	   Information	   Modelling	   and	   their	    respective	    benefits	    and	    capabilities	    to	    address	    the	    problems	    of	    production	   management	    in	    construction,	    research	    is	    emerging,	    which	    claims	    that	    while	   integrated,	    lean	    construction	    and	    BIM	    provides	    a	    robust	    solution,	    as	    they	    are	   synergistic	   in	   nature	   (Sacks	   et	   al.,	   2010a).	   As	   it	   was	   observed	   in	   section	   4.2,	   Lean	   Construction	   has	   three	   main	   functions	   to	   serve	   during	   the	   construction	   process:	   i.

Once	   clashes	   are	   found	   designers	   can	   correct	   the	   problems	   and	   iterate	   the	   models	   until	   they	    are	    clash	    free.	    By	    carrying	    out	    this	    activity	    virtually,	    a	    significant	   amount	   of	   time	   and	   money	   that	   would	   otherwise	   be	   wasted	   through	   rework	   or	    delay	    is	    saved.	    This	    would	    be	    nearly	    impossible	    to	    achieve	    with	   traditional	    2D	    CAD	    technologies,	    where	    even	    if	    drawings	    are	    overlaid	    on	   each	   other,	   they	   do	   not	   always	   make	   it	   easier	   for	   the	   user	   to	   identify	   where	   the	   clash	   would	   be	   in	   a	   three	   dimensional	   space,	   and	   there	   is	   no	   method	   to	   automate	   the	   clash	   checking.	   • Visualisation	    of	    coordinated/synchronised	    models:	    Similar	    to	    clash	   detection,	    models	    from	    separate	    disciplines	    are	    synchronised	    and	   visualised	   from	   the	   early	   conceptual	   design	   stage.	   This	   enables	   the	   clients	   and	    in	    particular	    end	    users	    to	    provide	    their	    input	    and	    for	    designers	    to	   better	    understand	    the	    requirements	    from	    the	    client.	    This	    also	    ensures	    a	   much	   better	   requirement	   and	   design	   intent	   flow	   down	   through	   the	   various	   stages	    of	    the	    project.	    This	    function	    contributes	    directly	    to	    waste	   minimisation	   and	   value	   generation	   principles	   of	   lean	   construction	   activities.	   However,	   it	   must	   be	   understood	   that	   for	   this	   to	   happen,	   early	   involvement	   of	    stakeholders	    in	    the	    project	    and	    use	    of	    BIM	    right	    from	    the	    conceptual	   design	   stage	   is	   a	   necessity.	   • Use	   of	   the	   BIM	   model	   during	   production:	   Collaborative	   planning	   is	   one	   of	   the	   key	   functions	   of	   Lean	   Construction	   and	   is	   very	   popular	   amongst	   the	   lean	   tools	    on	    construction	    projects	    in	    the	    UK.	    One	    of	    the	    key	    functions	    of	   collaborative	    planning	    is	    to	    gain	    a	    deeper	    understanding	    of	    the	    planned	   activities	   in	   advance.	   Also,	   one	   of	   the	   related	   activities	   is	   “first	   run	   studies”	   where	   users	   try	   different	   work	   methods	   and	   sequences	   to	   identify	   how	   a	   construction	   task	   can	   be	   best	   performed	   and	   optimised.	   By	   using	   BIM	   tools	   such	    as	    4D	    planning	    where	    a	    3D	    model	    is	    linked	    to	    the	    project	    plan	    and	   simulated	   to	   demonstrate	   the	   activities	   for	   a	   selected	   period,	   the	   team	   gains	   a	    much	    deeper	    understanding	    as	    compared	    to	    the	    use	    of	    2D	    drawings	   during	   planning	   meetings.	   Especially	   on	   a	   complex	   project	   where	   there	   are	   complicated	    services	    being	    installed,	    it	    becomes	    increasingly	    difficult	    for	   stakeholders	    to	    visualise	    the	    task	    at	    hand	    and	    also	    the	    sequence	    of	    the	   process.	   If	   used	   appropriately,	   4D	   scheduling	   can	   also	   serve	   the	   function	   of	   a	   virtual	   “first	   run	   study”.	   On	   the	   other	   hand,	   lean	   construction	   through	   its	   focus	   on	   collaboration	   right	   from	   the	   conceptual	   design	   stages,	   and	   emphasis	   on	   experimentation	   during	   production,	   provides	    a	    much	    conducive	    environment	    for	    BIM	    implementation.	    This	    is	   especially	   relevant	   during	   the	   initial	   strategic	   adoption	   of	   a	   new	   technology	   being	   applied	   in	   the	   project	   lifecycle.	   There	    are	    many	    other	    examples	    where	    lean	    functions	    are	    supported	    by	    BIM	   activities	   and	   vice	   versa.	   A	   detailed	   study	   was	   carried	   out	   by	   Sacks	   et	   al.	   (2010a)	   that	   found	   56	   unique	   interactions	   between	   BIM	   functions	   and	   Lean	   Construction	   processes.	    The	    authors	    also	    found	    empirical	    evidence	    of	    past	    and	    on-­‐going	   construction	    projects	    to	    support	    these	    interactions.	    Some	    key	    aspects	    that	   emerged	   during	   this	   study	   strongly	   support	   the	   notion	   that	   Lean	   Construction	   and	   BIM	   are	   not	   only	   synergistic	   but	   that	   the	   synergy	   spans	   the	   entire	   lifecycle	   of	   the	   project	   and	   not	   just	   design	   activities.	   During	   the	   study	   it	   was	   found	   that	   three	   lean	   principles	    had	    the	    most	    interactions	    with	    BIM	    functions	    (i.e.	    they	    are	    best	   supported	   by	   BIM)	   i. Reduction	   of	   waste	   by	   getting	   the	   quality	   right	   first	   time	   (through	   a	   better	   designed	   product,	   reducing	   the	   product	   variability,	   i.e.	   changes	   during	   the	   later	   stages	   of	   design)	   ii. Improving	    flow	    and	    reducing	    production	    uncertainty	    which	    eventually	   leads	   to	   iii. Reduction	   in	   overall	   construction	   time	   These	   are	   the	   core	   functions	   of	   lean	   construction,	   hence	   it	   can	   be	   deduced	   that	   if	   exploited	    properly,	    these	    two	    initiatives	    have	    right	    ingredients	    for	    a	    successful	   project	   delivery.	   However,	   it	   should	   also	   be	   noted	   that	   the	   discovery	   of	   the	   breadth	   and	   depth	   of	   interactions	   between	   Lean	   and	   BIM	   is	   of	   a	   relatively	   recent	   origin,	   and	   it	   is	   probable	   that	   new	   types	   of	   interaction	   will	   be	   found.	   Table	   8	   summarises	   some	   of	   these	   characteristics	   in	   various	   stages	   of	   the	   project.	    	   Table	   8.

(2006)	   used	   a	   set	   of	   lean	   principles	   as	   the	   theoretical	   framework.	   The	   authors	   define	   CAVT	   as	   “the	   collection	   of	   all	   necessary	   tools	   which	   allow	   for	   visual	   representation	   of	   the	   ends	   and	   means	   of	    AEC/EPC	    (Architectural,	    Engineering	    and	    Construction/Engineering	   Procurement	    and	    Construction)	    design	    and	    construction	    project…the	    CAVT	   definition	    also	    considers	    underlying	    information	    about	    facility	    components	    and	   activities	   that	   might	   lead	   to	   a	   3D	   rendering,	   a	   2D	   plot,	   a	   bill	   of	   materials,	   a	   work	   order	   report,	   or	   a	   virtual	   reality	   environment,	   each	   coming	   from	   a	   unique	   product	   and	    process	    model	    representation,	    which	    can	    be	    visualized	    through	    a	    computer	   based	   display	   device”.	   The	   authors’	   definition	   of	   CAVT	   is	   very	   close	   to	   what	   is	   now	   known	   as	   BIM,	   and	   can	   be	   considered	   as	   such.	    	   The	   authors	   placed	   key	   emphasis	   on	   value	   generation	   during	   the	   design	   stage	   of	   the	   construction	   project.	   Five	   key	   principles	   covering	   the	   value	   generation	   cycle	   in	   the	   design	   process	   were	   used	   as	   a	   qualitative	   framework	   to	   analyse	   the	   impact	   of	   CAVT.	   1. Customer	    requirements	    captured	    by	    the	    design:	    Aim	    to	    ensure	    that	    all	   customer	    requirements,	    both	    explicit	    and	    latent,	    have	    been	    captured	    by	    the	   design.	    	   2. Customer	    requirements	    available	    during	    the	    design:	    Aim	    to	    ensure	    that	   relevant	   customer	   requirements	   are	   available	   in	   all	   phases	   of	   production	   and	   that	    they	    are	    not	    lost	    when	    progressively	    transformed	    into	    design	    solutions,	   production	   plans,	   and	   products.	    	   3. Suitable	   capability	   of	   the	   production	   system:	   Aim	   to	   ensure	   the	   capability	   of	   the	   production	   system	   to	   produce	   as	   required.	    	   4. Construction	    requirements	    satisfaction:	    Aim	    to	    ensure	    that	    requirements	   and	    constraints	    of	    the	    construction	    process	    have	    	   been	    taken	    into	    account	   during	   design.	    	   5. Impact	   of	   design	   errors	   during	   construction:	   Aim	   to	   minimize	   	   the	   impact	   of	   design	   errors	   detected	   during	   construction.	    	   Based	   on	   the	   case	   studies	   conducted	   over	   a	   four	   year	   period,	   it	   was	   concluded	   that	   application	   of	   CAVT	   results	   in	   waste	   reduction,	   improved	   flow	   and	   better	   customer	   value,	    indicating	    a	    strong	    synergy	    between	    the	    lean	    construction	    principles	    and	   CAVT.	   The	   authors	   described	   the	   main	   observations	   of	   their	   comparison	   between	   the	    traditional	    and	    CAVT	    processes	    when	    applied	    on	    a	    construction	    project	    as	   shown	   in	   Table	   9.	   Overall,	   qualitative	   and	   quantitative	   improvements	   were	   noted	   in	    all	    aspects	    of	    the	    project.	    Some	    key	    observations	    from	    the	    production	   management	   perspective	   are	   noted	   below:	   Table	   9.	   Comparison	   of	   traditional	   design	   vs.	   CAVT	   (Rischmoller	   et	   al.,	   2006).	   Traditional CAVT It is a “push” based system where the design is treated as an “end goal” rather than the “mean”. Aspects such as constructability, minimising waste and resource management are not taken in account (or they are not effective). “Pull” based system where construction requirements drive the production system capability. The capability to visualise design alongside constructability early during the design stage helps minimise waste and manage resources effectively.  Early constructability reviews include design coordination meetings where the output is in form of notes and sketches. 3D design enables early in depth constructability reviews where the input from construction teams is fed back directly in design. During construction, the approach towards design is reactive, where the teams review already issued 2D drawings to identify changes, based on which design is reviewed and new set of drawings issued. In CAVT, 4D planning and scheduling helps identify problems in more natural way. Automatic clash detection of model elements helps “sanitise” the design before issuing drawings for construction resulting in less rework. The deficiencies in design and problems with communication of 2D drawings mean that the Request for Information (RFIs) or Notice of Change (NOC) requests are quite high during the construction stage. These problems also lead to rework and delays during construction ultimately leading to cost and time overrun. Early involvement of downstream stakeholders helps detect errors early and reduces RFIs and NOCs during construction. Ultimately this leads to increased efficiencies during construction and helping achieve construction within given time and budget. In	   Summary,	   it	   can	   be	   concluded	   that	   this	   early	   study	   exploring	   the	   link	   between	   Lean	   Construction	   and	   BIM	   (CAVT)	   reported	   some	   very	   positive	   findings.	   It	   also,	   highlighted	   specific	   benefits	   from	   Production	   Management	   perspective.	   The	   lean	   context	   through	   which	   the	   CAVT	   concept	   was	   validated	   and	   analysed	   also	   provides	   an	   interesting	   perspective,	   which	   is	   further,	   extended	   and	   explored	   by	   Sacks	   et	   al.	   (2010)	   and	   others	   and	   is	   discussed	   further	   in	   this	   section.	   4.5.2.2	   Virtual	   Design	   and	   Construction	   In	   another	   attempt	   to	   integrate	   lean	   construction	   processes	   with	   BIM,	   Khanzode	   et	   al.	   (2006)	   attempted	   to	   provide	   a	   conceptual	   framework	   to	   link	   Virtual	   Design	   &	   Construction	   (VDC)	   with	   the	   Lean	   Project	   Delivery	   Process	   (LPDS).	   VDC	   has	   been	   defined	    as	    “the	    use	    of	    multi-­‐disciplinary	    performance	    models	    of	    design-­construction	    projects,	    including	    the	    Product	    (i.e.,	    facilities),	    Work	    Processes	    and	   Organization	    of	    the	    design	    -­‐	    construction	    -­‐	    operation	    team	    in	    order	    to	    support	   business	   objectives”	   (Fischer	   et	   al.,	   2004).	   The	   authors	   claim	   the	   “VDC	   approach	   allows	   a	   practitioner	   to	   build	   a	   symbolic	   model	   of	   the	   product,	   organization	   and	   process	   (P-­‐O-­‐P)	   early	   before	   a	   large	   commitment	   of	   time	   or	   money	   has	   been	   made	   to	   the	   project”.	   According	   to	   the	   authors,	   VDC	   comprises	   of	   the	   following	   tools	   and	   techniques:	   • 3D	   visualisation	   tools	   such	   as	   Autodesk	   Revit,	   Architectural	   Desktop,	   etc.,	   i.e.	   systems	   that	   support	   the	   creation	   of	   a	   BIM	   model.	   The	   tools	   that	   help	   develop	   a	   common	   understanding	   of	   the	   project	   and	   also	   help	   coordinate	   the	   work	   of	   several	   disciplines.

Both	   are	   emerging,	   but	   they	    are	    being	    developed	    and	    their	    adoption	    within	    the	    industry	    is	    increasing	   rapidly.	   4.5.2.5	   Further	   evidence	   from	   the	   field	    	   Eastman	    et	    al.	    (2011)	    provide	    ten	    detailed	    case	    studies	    of	    BIM	    implementation,	   two	   of	   which	   focus	   on	   projects	   in	   which	   prefabrication	   was	   used	   extensively.	   In	   the	   context	   of	   detailed	   design	   for	   fabrication	   and	   delivery	   by	   subcontracted	   suppliers	   of	    prefabricated	    elements,	    they	    comment	    that	    ‘Lean	    construction	    techniques	   require	    careful	    coordination	    between	    the	    general	    contractor	    and	    subs	    to	    ensure	   that	   work	   can	   be	   performed	   when	   the	   appropriate	   resources	   are	   available	   onsite.

It	   also	   emerges	   that	   their	   simultaneous	   development	   brings	   higher	    benefits	    than	    their	    individual	    implementation.	    The	    early	    belief	    that	    BIM	   only	    addresses	    the	    design	    stage	    in	    a	    construction	    project	    and	    is	    only	    partially	   useful	   during	   the	   production	   stage,	   is	   negated	   as	   it	   becomes	   clear	   that	   BIM	   can	   be	   applied	   through	   the	   whole	   lifecycle	   of	   the	   facility.	    	   The	   following	   section	   provides	   a	   summary	   of	   the	   currently	   available	   commercial	   BIM	   systems	   for	   production	   management.	    	   4.6	   Current	   BIM	   Systems	   for	   Production	   Management	   It	   is	   important	   to	   identify	   what	   are	   the	   current	   systems	   in	   the	   market	   that	   support	   the	    construction	    management/production	    management	    activities.	    Also,	    to	    avoid	   duplicating	   the	   features	   available	   with	   the	   current	   commercial	   systems,	   their	   main	   limitations	    and	    available	    features	    should	    also	    be	    identified.	    These	    features	    may	   include,	   but	   are	   not	   limited	   to:	   i. Construction	   sequencing	   –	   known	   as	   4D	   simulation	   ii. Clash	    detection	    –	    analysing	    clashes	    between	    various	    designs	    (such	    as	   architectural,	   structural	   and	   MEP)	   iii. Visualisation	   of	   design	   during	   construction	   iv. Communication,	   including	   marking	   up	   of	   design	   for	   clarification	   v. Quantity	   and	   cost	   take-­‐off	   vi. Constraints	   analysis	   vii. Evaluation	   of	   what-­‐if	   scenarios	   viii. Visual	   tracking	   of	   progress	   4.6.1	   Autodesk	   Navisworks	   Navisworks	    was	    originally	    developed	    by	    the	    Sheffield	    based	    developer	    of	    same	   name,	    but	    was	    later	    acquired	    by	    Autodesk	    in	    June	    2007.	    Navisworks	    is	   predominantly	    a	    construction	    visualisation,	    clash	    detection	    and	    4D	    simulation	   platform.	   It	   also	   let’s	   users	   save	   animations	   from	   visualisation	   or	   create	   snapshots	   of	   3D	   views	   that	   can	   be	   rendered	   and	   shared	   with	   others.	   One	   of	   the	   core	   features	   of	   Navisworks	   is	   that	   it	   can	   work	   with	   all	   major	   file	   types	   produced	   by	   different	   BIM	   (and	   3D	   CAD)	   software.	   It	   is	   well	   understood	   that	   even	   within	   a	   single	   construction	   project,	   BIM	   models	   from	   various	   applications	   could	   be	   developed.	   With	   Navisworks	   it	   is	   possible	   to	   synchronise/combine	   such	   models	   and	   perform	   the	   aforementioned	   functions	   such	   as	   visualisation,	   clash	   detection,	   etc.	   The	   other	   important	   feature	   of	   Navisworks	   is	   its	   ability	   to	   handle	   large	   files.	    	   Navisworks	   has	   two	   versions:	   • A	   free	   viewing	   software	   called	   Navisworks	   Freedom	   • Navisworks	   Manage	   with	   full	   features	   as	   discussed	   next	   Some	   of	   the	   key	   features	   of	   Navisworks	   Manage	   are	   described	   below:	   4.6.1.1.	   Coordination	   Coordination,	    formerly	    known	    as	    Clash	    Detective,	    as	    the	    name	    suggests	    lets	    the	   user	    combine	    several	    models	    (such	    as	    Architectural,	    Structural,	    Mechanical	    &	   Electrical)	   and	   check	   them	   against	   physical	   or	   clearance	   clashes.	   Physical	   clashes	   are	    where	    various	    elements	    collide	    with	    each	    other	    physically	    (where	    this	   behaviour	    is	    not	    expected),	    whereas	    clearance	    clashes	    are	    present	    when	    the	   clearance	   between	   two	   or	   more	   objects	   is	   less	   than	   the	   minimum	   specified.	   The	   clash	   detection	   feature	   is	   one	   of	   the	   most	   useful	   tools	   throughout	   the	   design	   and	   early	   construction	   stages	   where	   design	   is	   still	   evolving.	   It	   lets	   users	   identify	   and	   resolve	    clashes	    which	    otherwise	    would	    have	    occurred	    during	    construction	    and	   caused	   delays.	   4.6.1.2	   Simulation	   and	   Analysis	   TimeLiner	   is	   a	   4D	   simulation	   tool	   which	   lets	   users	   integrate/connect	   a	   project	   plan	   with	   the	   3D	   model	   to	   simulate	   the	   project	   as	   it	   would	   be	   developed	   according	   to	   the	    given	    schedule.	    It	    is	    possible	    to	    import	    plans	    from	    popular	   programming/scheduling	    system	    such	    as	    Primavera,	    Microsoft	    Project,	    Asta	   Teamplan,	   etc.	   The	   new	   versions	   of	   the	   software	   also	   enable	   linking	   cost	   data	   to	   the	   schedules	   to	   create	   what	   is	   known	   as	   5D	   models.	   4.6.1.3	   Project	   Viewing	   Formerly	    known	    as	    Presenter,	    NavisWorks	    provides	    a	    set	    of	    advanced	   visualisation	    tools	    that	    lets	    users	    navigate	    an	    existing	    BIM	    model.	    There	    are	   features	   such	   as:	    	   • Enabling	   gravity	   to	   provide	   a	   more	   realistic	   experience	   where	   the	   virtual	   “avatar”	   can’t	   walk	   through	   walls,	   and	   can	   climb	   stairs,	   etc.	   • Flythrough,	   where	   quick	   visualisation	   without	   gravity	   rules	   is	   possible	   • Several	    tools	    that	    help	    navigate	    the	    model	    such	    as	    ViewCube	    and	   SteeringWheel.	   4.6.1.4	   Project	   Review	   Project	   review	   covers	   the	   following	   features:	   • Model	   file	   and	   data	   aggregation:	   Enables	   several	   data	   source	   such	   as	   laser	   scans	   and	   2D	   or	   3D	   models	   to	   be	   combined	   with	   the	   main	   model	   • Review	   toolkit:	   Provides	   tools	   for	   measurement	   from	   the	   model	   (distance,	   size,	    etc),	    storing	    camera	    views	    and	    cross	    sections	    and	    software	   automation.	   • Model	    publishing:	    Enables	    publishing	    the	    model	    to	    native	    and	    other	    file	   formats	   and	   also	   lets	   users	   control	   the	   security	   features	   • Collaboration	    toolkit:	    Users	    can	    add	    mark-­‐ups	    to	    models	    which	    can	    be	   shared	   with	   other	   users	   for	   model	   based	   communication	   4.6.2	   Bentley	   ProjectWise	   Navigator	   Bentley	   is	   also	   one	   of	   the	   platforms	   that	   has	   a	   wide	   range	   of	   BIM	   product	   portfolio.	   Their	    product	    Betnely’s	    ProjectWise	    Navigator	    is	    used	    predominantly	    for	   collaboration	    during	    project	    and	    offers	    construction	    management	    features.	   ProjectWise	    Navigator	    has	    replaced	    previous	    Bentley	    applications	    –	    Bentley	   Explorer,	    Photo	    Realism,	    Bentley	    Explorer	    NWD	    and	    Interface	    Detection.	   ProjectWise	   supports	   all	   major	   type	   of	   BIM,	   CAD	   and	   other	   geospatial	   models.

As	    Vico’s	    production	    management	   features	   are	   based	   on	   the	   Line	   of	   Balance	   (Location	   Based	   Scheduling)	   method,	   it	   also	   offers	   the	   users	   the	   capability	   to	   split	   the	   model	   by	   locations.	   It	   is	   possible	   for	   users	   to	   define	   and	   save	   comparisons	   and	   re-­‐run	   the	   comparison	   (clash	   detection)	   when	   a	   new	   model	   becomes	   available.	   It	   is	   then	   possible	   to	   issue	   and	   manage	   RFIs	   from	    the	    software.	    It	    is	    also	    possible	    for	    users	    to	    annotate	    models	    and	   communicate	    with	    other	    users	    to	    clarify	    design	    and	    construction	    related	    issues.	   Users	   can	   also	   use	   the	   synchronised	   models	   for	   quantity	   take-­‐off	   directly	   from	   the	   software.	    Quantity	    take-­‐off	    can	    be	    based	    on	    locations	    to	    obtain	    better	    clarity.	    A	   feature	   of	   Vico	   is	   to	   develop	   cost	   calculations	   based	   on	   recipes,	   where	   a	   recipe	   is	   a	   description	    of	    the	    material,	    labour	    and	    other	    resources	    required	    to	    complete	    a	   task,	   and	   is	   a	   part	   of	   the	   cost	   database.	   4.6.4.3	   Scheduling	   and	   Production	   Control:	   As	   mentioned	   above,	   Vico	   is	   based	   on	   the	   Line	   of	   Balance	   method	   of	   scheduling	   and	    has	    a	    module	    called	    LBS	    Manager	    that	    lets	    users	    divide	    the	    model	    by	    work	   locations.	    Once	    the	    models	    are	    divided,	    they	    can	    be	    linked	    to	    tasks,	    and	   subsequently	   to	   resources	   such	   as	   material,	   labour	   equipment,	   etc.	   Based	   on	   the	   linked	   plan	   with	   model,	   4D	   simulation	   can	   be	   generated	   to	   develop	   a	   4D	   plan	   of	   the	   project.	   4.6.4.4	   Reporting	   and	   Analysis	   Reports	   such	   as	   constructability	   (clash	   detection	   and	   mark-­‐ups),	   quantity	   take	   off	   (overall	    and	    by	    locations),	    project	    cost	    reports,	    visual	    budget,	    flowline	    (line	    of	   balance),	   and	   resource	   histograms	   can	   be	   generated	   directly	   from	   the	   software.	   It	   is	   also	   possible	   to	   produce	   a	   production	   control	   chart	   that	   can	   represent	   a	   weekly	   report	   (tasks	   completed	   in	   a	   week).	   4.6.5	   Tekla	   CM	   and	   BIMSight	   One	    of	    the	    oldest	    parametric	    modelling	    software,	    Tekla	    also	    provides	    software	   capabilities	    for	    construction	    management.	    Tekla’s	    strength	    is	    in	    it’s	    structural	   modelling	    capabilities	    especially	    in	    steel	    structures.	    However,	    Tekla	    can	    accept	   models	    from	    most	    other	    authoring	    tools	    and	    has	    extensive	    IFC	    file	    handling	   capabilities.	   Due	   to	   its	   steel	   detailing	   and	   modelling	   heritage,	   it	   is	   also	   one	   of	   the	   software	    platforms	    that	    integrate	    well	    with	    model	    based	    prefabrication	    (where	   model	    data	    can	    be	    directly	    sent	    to	    manufacturing	    machines	    to	    automate	   fabrication	    of	    components)	    using	    CNC	    (Computer	    Numeric	    Control).	    Tekla	    also	   offers	   a	   free	   software	   tool	   called	   BIMSight,	   which	   enables	   users	   to	   import	   models	   from	   all	   popular	   authoring	   tools,	   visualise	   them,	   perform	   clash	   detection,	   review,	   mark	   up	   and	   measure	   and	   also	   communicate	   with	   other	   team	   members.	   Some	   of	   the	   key	   features	   provided	   by	   Tekla	   CM	   and	   BIMSight	   are:	   • Visualisation	    and	    navigation	    of	    multiple	    models	    (combining	    multiple	   discipline	   models)	   • Review	   and	   markup	   of	   models	   and	   sharing	   with	   other	   users	   • Automated	   clash	   detection	   • Communication	    with	    other	    members	    by	    creating,	    sharing	    notes	    (and	   annotations)	   and	   online	   sharing	   with	   other	   members.	   • Performing	   4D	   simulation	   using	   Tekla	   CM	   –	   by	   linking	   project	   plan	   with	   the	   combined	   model	   • Procurement	    integration	    –	    automated	    updates	    in	    3D	    about	    material	   movement	   (material	   tracking)	    	   4.6.6	   Solibri	   Model	   Checker	   Solibri,	    a	    Finnish	    software	    company	    provides	    a	    solution	    called	    Solibri	    Model	   Checker	   that	   analyses	   Building	   Information	   Models	   to	   check	   for	   integrity,	   quality	   and	   physical	   safety	   based	   on	   the	   rules	   defined	   by	   the	   users.	   The	   software	   also	   lets	   users	   combine	   models	   from	   various	   disciplines,	   visualise	   them	   and	   perform	   clash	   detection	   for	   constructability	   analysis.	   Solibri	   is	   known	   for	   its	   rules	   based	   checking	   engine.	   Solibri	   Model	   Checker	   offers	   the	   following	   features:	   • Import	   BIM	   models	   from	   all	   major	   authoring	   platforms	   and	   also	   IFC	   files	   • Automated	    checking	    and	    analysis	    of	    the	    building	    design	    based	    on	    pre-­defined	    rules,	    highlighting	    potential	    problems	    in	    3D	    and	    classification	    of	   issues	   based	   on	   severity.	    	   • Automated	   space	   analysis	   and	   measurement	   • Automated	   quantity	   take	   off	   • Automated	   clash	   checking	   based	   on	   components’	   design	   discipline	   and	   type	   and	   severity	   • Safety	   analysis	   of	   the	   model	   both	   from	   construction	   and	   also	   from	   Facility	   Management	   perspective	   • 3D	   visualisation	   with	   walk-­‐through	   and	   use	   of	   gaming	   controls	   4.6.7	   Comparison	   between	   systems	   As	   it	   can	   be	   seen	   from	   the	   above	   discussion,	   all	   major	   systems	   offer	   the	   following	   basic	   features:	   • Visualisation	    of	    the	    combined	    model	    to	    gain	    better	    understanding	    of	    the	   design	   • Clash	   detection	   between	   different	   models	   for	   constructability	   analysis	   • 4D	   planning	   –	   linking	   of	   the	   project	   plan	   (mostly	   at	   master	   plan	   level)	   to	   the	   model	   and	   creating	   a	   simulation	   of	   the	   project	   • Marking	   up	   models	   and	   collaborative	   sharing	   of	   mark	   up	   Table	   11	   provides	   a	   comparison	   between	   the	   above-­‐mentioned	   systems	   from	   their	   construction	    management	    capability	    viewpoint.	    The	    above	    mentioned	    software	   systems	    have	    features	    in	    different	    ways,	    their	    functionality	    may	    differ	    slightly	   while	    in	    use.	    These	    tools	    offer	    some	    significant	    benefit	    over	    the	    traditional	    CAD	   systems	    where	    construction	    users	    have	    to	    use	    imagination	    to	    gain	    a	    deeper	   understanding	    and	    yet	    some	    of	    the	    functions	    such	    as	    clash	    detection	    or	    4D	   simulation	    would	    not	    be	    possible	    to	    achieve.	    A	    wide	    range	    of	    case	    examples	    of	   benefits	   is	   emerging	   from	   the	   use	   of	   such	   systems	   in	   the	   industry.	   On	   some	   of	   the	   complex	   projects	   such	   as	   a	   hospital,	   multi	   storey	   commercial	   building,	   stadiums,	   etc.	   it	   is	   not	   uncommon	   to	   identify	   several	   hundred	   if	   not	   thousand	   clashes	   during	   design	    and	    early	    construction	    stages	    (Eastman	    et	    al.,	    2011,	    Kymmell,	    2008).	    If	   found	   during	   construction,	   these	   clashes	   and	   other	   constructability	   issues	   would	   cause	   significant	   delays	   and	   cost	   overruns	   to	   the	   project	   outcomes.	   Hence,	   it	   can	   be	   concluded	   that	   these	   tools	   are	   highly	   beneficial.	   However,	    in	    terms	    of	    detailed	    production	    planning,	    scheduling	    and	    control	   capabilities,	    the	    capability	    of	    BIM	    tools	    still	    remains	    limited.	    Barring	    Vico	    and	   Synchro,	   none	   of	   the	   tools	   offer	   detailed	   production	   planning	   and	   resource	   linkage	   to	    the	    production	    plans,	    and	    mostly	    offer	    4D	    planning	    capability	    which	    let	    the	   users	   simulate	   the	   project	   ony	   at	   the	   master	   plan	   level.	    	   Both	    Synchro	    and	    Vico	    demonstrate	    some	    capability	    to	    provide	    a	    detailed	   production	   planning	   by	   enabling	   the	   development	   of	   detailed	   plans	   and	   links	   to	   the	   model.	    Also,	    neither	    Synchro	    nor	    Vico	    offer	    the	    “pull”	    production	    management	   capability,	    however	    Vico	    has	    partially	    implemented	    the	    Lookahead	    scheduling	   workflow.	    Also,	    Vico	    is	    predominantly	    based	    on	    the	    Line	    of	    Balance	    scheduling	   method	   and	   for	   projects	   which	   are	   not	   using	   this	   method	   or	   the	   teams	   which	   are	   not	   familiar	   with	   the	   method,	   the	   usability	   remains	   somewhat	   limited.	   It	    was	    found	    from	    the	    feedback	    gathered	    from	    key	    users	    that	    both	    Vico	    and	   Synchro	    are	    of	    complex	    nature	    and	    prior	    training	    and	    experience	    is	    required	   before	   the	   users	   can	   start	   to	   use	   them	   to	   its	   full	   potential.	   This	   remains	   one	   of	   the	   critical	    issues	    for	    software	    being	    used	    for	    production	    planning	    and	    control.	    For	   such	   a	   complex	   system,	   it	   may	   not	   be	   possible	   to	   train	   the	   whole	   supply	   chain	   and	   site	   team	   in	   using	   the	   system	   on	   daily	   or	   weekly	   basis,	   hence	   it	   remains	   a	   tool	   to	   be	   used	   by	   a	   selected	   few	   users	   located	   at	   the	   head-­‐office	   or	   a	   central	   BIM	   team.	   This	   somewhat	   limits	   the	   usability	   of	   the	   system	   to	   be	   used	   on	   site.	    	   Also,	   neither	   of	   the	   system	   provides	   detailed	   constraints	   analysis	   at	   task	   level	   or	   assignment	   of	   responsibility	   and	   real-­‐time	   task	   status	   updates	   to	   enable	   accurate	   production	   planning.	   As	   it	   was	   observed,	   one	   of	   the	   cornerstone	   principles	   of	   pull	   planning	   is	   to	   carry	   out	   detailed	   constrains	   analysis	   at	   the	   look-­‐ahead	   and	   weekly	   planning	    level	    and	    to	    assign	    responsibility	    to	    task/trade	    leaders/managers	    to	   ensure	    the	    constraints	    are	    removed	    before	    the	    tasks	    are	    considered	    for	   production.	   However,	   such	   level	   of	   production	   planning	   is	   not	   yet	   available	   in	   any	   of	   the	   commercially	   available	   systems.	   It	   was	   also	   discussed	   in	   section	   3	   that	   a	   range	   of	   information	   sources	   have	   to	   be	   integrated	   in	   the	   production	   management	   systems	   in	   real-­‐time	   to	   enable	   accurate	   decision	    making.	    Information	    such	    as	    material	    procurement	    and	    delivery,	   equipment	    hire	    and	    availability,	    labour	    availability,	    space	    availability,	    etc.	    Again,	   none	   of	   the	   commercial	   systems	   mentioned	   can	   deal	   with	   dynamic	   integration	   of	   such	    information	    sources	    (which	    could	    originate	    from	    individual	    information	   systems	    such	    as	    main	    contractor’s	    or	    subcontractors’	    Enterprise	    Resource	   Planning	   system).	   Hence	    it	    can	    be	    concluded	    from	    the	    above	    discussion	    that	    while	    the	    current	   systems	   offer	   a	   significant	   improvement	   compared	   to	   the	   traditional	   2D	   CAD	   and	   3D	    CAD	    systems	    from	    the	    production	    planning	    and	    control	    perspective,	    there	    is	   still	    potential	    for	    improvement	    and	    a	    gap	    in	    the	    current	    commercial	    product	   availability.	   Table	    11.	    Comparison	    between	    Construction	    Management	    Capabilities	    of	    BIM	   Systems.	   	   4.7	   State-­‐of-­‐the-­‐art	   in	   software	   systems	   for	   production	   management	   The	   area	   of	   production	   management	   (planning	   and	   control)	   software	   systems	   has	   been	   relatively	   under	   researched.	   Most	   research	   in	   the	   area	   of	   BIM	   (or	   computer	   aided	    design)	    based	    visualisation	    in	    construction	    has	    been	    focused	    around	    pre-­construction	   planning	   and	   design	   stages	   (Sacks	   et	   al.,	   2009).	   Apart	   from	   one,	   all	   other	   systems	   discussed	   here	   are	   research	   systems.	   However,	   there	   have	   been	   few	   notable	   exceptions,	   which	   are	   discussed	   in	   this	   section.	   4.7.1	   WorkPlan	   System	    	   Choo	    et	    al.	    (1999)	    developed	    a	    software	    system	    developed	    at	    the	    University	    of	   California	   at	   Berkeley	   called	   “WorkPlan”	   that	   helps	   systematically	   develop	   weekly	   work	    plans.	    WorkPlan	    was	    based	    on	    the	    Last	    Planner	    method	    of	    production	   planning	   and	   implementations	   constraints	   analysis	   and	   other	   lean	   principles.	   The	   following	   were	   the	   key	   features	   of	   the	   system:	   Planning	   &	   Scheduling:	   • Spell	   out	   work	   packages	   • Identify	   constraints	   • Checking	   constraint	   satisfaction	   • Releasing	   work	   packages	   &	   • Allocating	   resources	   Reporting	   and	   Analysis:	   • Collecting	   field	   progress	   data	   • Reasons	   for	   plan	   failure	   The	   WorkPlan	   system	   was	   developed	   using	   Microsoft	   Access	   7.0	   database	   and	   VBA	   (Visual	   Basic	   Access)	   as	   the	   programming	   language.	    	   Figure	   14	   shows	   the	   work	   package	   entry	   form.	   For	   each	   work	   package	   entered	   in	   the	   system,	   five	   constraints	   are	   automatically	   generated	   by	   the	   system	   by	   default,	   namely:	   • Contract	   • Engineering	   • Materials	   • Labour	   and	   equipment	   • Prerequisite	   work	   	   Figure	   14.

Work	   Package	   constraints	   input	   screen	   in	   WorkPlan.	   Any	    constraints	    or	    problems	    relevant	    to	    each	    of	    the	    categories	    are	    input	    by	    the	   user	    and	    once	    the	    resolution	    is	    achieved,	    they	    are	    marked	    as	    complete,	    as	   demonstrated	   in	   Figure	   15	   above.	    	   The	   system	   also	   allowed	   resource	   management	   for	   work	   packages	   by	   letting	   the	   users	    enter	    labour	    and	    equipment	    requirement	    for	    each	    work	    package.	    These	   requirements	    were	    then	    compared	    against	    the	    actual	    usage,	    and	    also	    their	    cost	   analysed.	   From	   reporting	   perspective,	   the	   system	   generated	   a	   weekly	   work	   plan	   at	   the	   Work	   Package	   level	   and	   also	   generated	   the	   PPC,	   reason	   for	   non-­‐completion	   and	   timesheet	   reports.	   WorkPlan	    was	    one	    of	    the	    early	    examples	    of	    a	    Production	    Management	    system	   based	   on	   lean	   methodology.	   Although	   it	   facilitated	   constraints	   analysis	   and	   look-­ahead	   planning,	   the	   system	   did	   not	   go	   beyond	   the	   work	   package	   level	   (i.e.	   break	   the	   work	   package	   down	   to	   tasks)	   and	   assign	   individual	   constraints	   to	   tasks.	   Also,	   the	    constraints	    allocation	    to	    responsible	    actors	    and	    communication	    between	   workers/task	   leaders,	   foreman	   and	   project	   managers	   was	   not	   supported.	   Also,	   one	   of	   the	   other	   crucial	   aspects	   that	   was	   ignored	   was	   the	   direct	   engagement	   of	   the	   Last	   Planners	    (the	    construction	    team).	    Due	    to	    the	    complexity	    and	    the	    style	    of	    the	   system,	    it	    would	    require	    a	    Planner	    assigned	    to	    the	    project	    to	    develop	    work	   packages	   and	   facilitate	   the	   use	   of	   the	   system.	    	   One	   of	   the	   other	   missing	   feature	   was	   the	   product	   information,	   or	   visualisation	   of	   the	   project	   model	   (such	   as	   a	   BIM	   model).	   This	   is	   probably	   due	   to	   the	   fact	   that	   BIM	   was	   still	   in	   its	   infancy,	   and	   CAD	   systems	   do	   not	   support	   such	   kind	   of	   integration.	   4.7.2	   LEWIS	   LEWIS,	    which	    stands	    for	    Lean	    Enterprise	    Web-­‐based	    Information	    System	    for	   Construction,	   is	   a	   research	   prototype	   software	   system	   developed	   at	   the	   University	   of	   Teesside	   (Sriprasert	   and	   Dawood,	   2003).	   LEWIS	   supports	   what	   the	   authors	   describe	   as	   multi-­‐constraint	   planning	   technique.	   This	   technique	   takes	   into	   consideration	   the	   following	   requirements	   as	   outlined	   by	   Sriprasert	   and	   Dawood	   (2003):	   • Collaborative	    and	    multi-­‐level	    planning	    –	    This	    refers	    to	    collaborative	   planning	    where	    work	    crew	    (Last	    Planners),	    project	    planners	    and	    other	   upstream	   stakeholders	   (such	   as	   clients)	   participate	   in	   the	   planning	   process	   during	   project	   execution.	   • Constraints	    analysis	    –	    Consideration	    and	    analysis	    of	    physical,	    contract,	   resource	    and	    information	    constraints,	    and	    their	    evaluation	    and	   communication.	   • Effective	    handling	    of	    uncertainty	    –	    Proactively	    identifying	    uncertainties,	   and	   compensating	   by	   inserting	   appropriate	   buffers.	    	   • Visual	    representation	    of	    planning	    –	    Visual	    representation	    of	    planning	   output.	   • Practicable	    optimisation	    –	    hybrid	    optimisation	    technique	    comprising	    of	   genetic	   algorithm	   and	   heuristic	   approaches.	   Figure	   16	   provides	   an	   overview	   of	   the	   LEWIS	   workflow.	   	   Figure	   16.	   Workflow	   for	   the	   LEWIS	   system	   (Sriprasert	   and	   Dawood,	   2003).	   The	    central	    idea	    of	    LEWIS	    system	    is	    to	    provide	    planners	    accurate	    information	   about	    constraints,	    which	    they	    can	    consider	    while	    developing	    Look-­‐ahead	    and	   Weekly	    assignments	    to	    the	    production	    teams	    at	    site.	    The	    production	    teams	    will	   then	    retrieve	    this	    information,	    raise	    queries/questions	    regarding	    practical	   problems,	    seek	    resolution	    where	    needed	    and	    execute	    the	    work.	    LEWIS	    was	   developed	    using	    SQL	    server	    as	    the	    database	    layer,	    which	    integrates	    information	   from	   the	   product	   model	   (CAD),	   process	   model	   (schedule),	   upstream	   information	   (specifications,	   method	   statements,	   resources	   information,	   etc.)	   and	   downstream	   information	   (weekly	   work	   plan	   and	   feedback).	   The	   main	   interface	   was	   constructed	   using	    HTML	    (Hyper	    Text	    Markup	    Language),	    Active	    Server	    Pages,	    VB	    Script	    and	   Java	    Script.	    The	    visualisation	    interface	    was	    developed	    using	    VBA	    (Visual	    Basic	   Application)	   and	   Autdesk	   Architectural	   Desktop	   3.3.	    	   The	   system	   provided	   following	   functions:	   • Look-­‐ahead	    planning:	    Shown	    in	    Figure	    17,	    this	    module	    facilitated	   development	    of	    look-­‐ahead	    plans	    which	    was	    supported	    by	    visual	   constraints	    analysis	    (linked	    to	    the	    3D	    product	    model)	    and	    offered	   automated	   optimisation	   based	   on	   the	   constraint	   statuses.	    	   • Multi	    Constraint	    Analysis:	    This	    aspect	    of	    the	    system	    relied	    on	    the	   stakeholders	    to	    input	    relevant	    constraint	    related	    information	    into	    the	   system	    such	    as	    readiness	    of	    information,	    resource,	    activities	    (other	   production	   activities).	   • Constraint,	    product	    and	    process	    visualisation:	    Integrated	    with	    3D	   information	    using	    Architectural	    Desktop	    3.3,	    the	    system	    enabled	    linking	   tasks	    and	    constraints	    to	    the	    product	    model.	    It	    also	    enabled	    the	   visualisation	   of	    	   o Space	   constraints	   (process	   clashes)	   o Resource	   constraints	    	   o Status	   of	   planned	   and	   actual	   work	   • Weekly/Commitment	   planning:	   Based	   on	   the	   look-­‐ahead	   plan,	   the	   project	   superintendents	    were	    asked	    to	    generate	    a	    work-­‐plan	    by	    adding	    sub-­activities	   under	   a	   constraint	   free	   activity.	    	   • Work	    face	    instruction	    –	    Other	    work	    related	    information	    such	    as	   specifications,	   work	   instruction	   and	   drawings	   were	   linked	   to	   the	   system	   to	   enable	   better	   facilitation	   of	   work	   • Feedback	   –	   Charting	   of	   PPC	   (Percentage	   plan	   complete)	   and	   reasons	   for	   non-­‐completion	   was	   facilitated.	   Figure	   17.	   Example	   of	   look-­‐ahead	   analysis	   (Sriprasert	   and	   Dawood,	   2003).	   As	   a	   concept	   LEWIS	   provided	   a	   substantial	   template	   for	   a	   production	   management	   system	   based	   on	   the	   Lean	   Construction	   concept	   that	   also	   integrated	   with	   product	   model.	    However,	    LEWIS	    still	    relied	    on	    the	    planner	    to	    carry	    out	    much	    of	    the	   planning	   and	   scheduling	   activities	   rather	   than	   enabling	   site	   users	   to	   manage	   the	   production	   planning	   and	   giving	   them	   access	   to	   product	   and	   process	   visualisation.	   Also,	    as	    the	    BIM	    applications	    were	    not	    developed	    at	    that	    time	    that	    offered	   parametric	    capabilities	    or	    had	    API	    (Application	    Programming	    Interface)	    to	   integrate	   to,	   LEWIS	   could	   not	   take	   advantage	   of	   the	   product	   visualisation	   fully.	   The	   implementation	    of	    the	    concept	    (system	    architecture)	    in	    the	    prototype	    also	   highlighted	    some	    limitations.	    For	    example,	    the	    Look-­‐ahead	    planning	    module	    did	   not	    offer	    activity	    level	    planning,	    and	    excluded	    production	    level	    activities/tasks	   from	    Look-­‐ahead	    planning.	    Instead	    it	    relied	    on	    the	    site	    team	    to	    add	    the	    sub-­activities	   to	   Look-­‐ahead	   plan	   once	   constraint	   analysis	   was	   carried	   out.	   However,	   constraint	    analysis	    relies	    on	    breaking	    phases	    and	    work-­‐packages	    into	    smaller	   activities	    and	    analysing	    the	    constraints	    associated	    with	    them,	    which	    was	    not	   possible,	   hence	   a	   major	   limitation.	    	   4.7.3	   Bentley	   ConstructSim	   ConstructSim	   is	   a	   virtual	   construction	   simulation	   software	   developed	   by	   Bentley	   for	   automated	   workface	   planning	   in	   large	   projects.	   Amongst	   other	   features,	   it	   also	   provides	    partial	    ability	    to	    carry	    out	    Look-­‐ahead	    planning,	    visualisation	    of	   production	    states	    (status	    tracking),	    and	    construction	    schedule	    animations.	    The	   Look-­‐ahead	   planning	   is	   partly	   automated	   based	   on	   the	   status	   of	   the	   constraints,	   where	   the	   system	   dynamically	   tracks,	   updates	   and	   edits	   the	   work	   packages	   based	   on	   the	   status	   of	   the	   constraints.	   A	   screenshot	   showing	   constraints	   analysis	   feature	   is	   shown	   in	   Figure	   18.	    	   To	   visualise	   component	   statuses	   with	   construction	   status	   tracking,	   users	   mark	   and	   track	    individual	    model	    component	    or	    groups	    to	    see	    a	    colour-­‐coded	    3D	    image	   representing	    construction	    status.	    Construction	    work	    packages	    can	    be	    created	   visually,	    by	    organising	    components	    into	    construction	    work	    areas,	    construction	   work	   packages,	   and	   installation	   work	   packages.	   The	    system	    also	    provides	    collaborative	    environment	    where	    the	    system	    can	    be	   shared	   with	   the	   suppliers	   and	   subcontractors.	    	   	   Figure	   18.	   Constraints	   analysis	   with	   Bentley	   ConstructSim	   (Bentley,	   2011).	   Although,	   the	   system	   provides	   the	   ability	   to	   carry	   out	   constraints	   analysis,	   look-­ahead	    planning	    and	    product	    and	    process	    visualisation,	    the	    software	    is	    aimed	    at	   planners	    and	    technical	    managers	    rather	    than	    the	    construction	    team	    or	    the	    Last	   Planners.	    Also,	    rather	    than	    providing	    information	    to	    the	    construction	    team	    and	   letting	   them	   take	   decisions	   about	   the	   planning	   and	   execution	   process,	   the	   system	   tries	   to	   automate	   this	   process,	   and	   also	   generates	   a	   list	   of	   pre-­‐defined	   constraints.	   In	   ConstructSim,	   the	   focus	   on	   breakdown	   of	   activities	   and	   work	   packages	   is	   very	   similar	   to	   a	   CPM	   or	   a	   “T”	   based	   production	   planning	   and	   control	   method.	    	   4.7.4	   Integrated	   Project	   Scheduler	   Chua	   et	   al.	   (2003)	   describe	   Integrated	   Project	   Scheduler	   as	   a	   person	   or	   a	   group	   who	   develops	   construction	   schedules	   with	   integrated	   information	   to	   improve	   the	   reliability	    of	    the	    production	    process,	    improve	    productivity	    and	    quality.	    The	   Integrated	   Project	   Scheduler	   is/are	   equivalent	   to	   the	   Last	   Planners	   as	   described	   in	   the	   Last	   Planner™	   System.	   They	   propose	   a	   system	   based	   on	   the	   Lean	   Construction	   philosophy	    and	    the	    Last	    Planner	    process	    to	    enable	    computer	    based	    integrated	   information	    management	    system	    for	    production.	    The	    key	    principles	    of	    the	    IPS	   system	   are	   defined	   as:	   • Integrated	    information:	    Integrates	    supporting	    information	    (for	    example	   resource	   and	   information)	   • Activeness:	    System	    actively	    responds	    to	    changes	    in	    construction	    and	   supports	   the	   pull	   flow	   in	   production	   • Distributed	    system:	    Distributed	    system	    enabling	    collaboration	    between	   stakeholders	   and	   improving	   transparency.	    	   Figure	    19	    demonstrates	    the	    principles	    of	    the	    IPS	    system	    in	    relation	    to	    the	    Lean	   Construction	   principles.	   The	    Integrated	    Project	    Scheduler	    was	    developed	    using	    JavaBean,	    XML	    database	   and	   Internet	   based	   communication.	   A	   prototype	   was	   created	   to	   demonstrate	   the	   functionality	   where	   a	   number	   of	   functions	   were	   demonstrated.

The	    system	    enabled	    data	   retrieval	    from	    the	    XML	    (Extensible	    Markup	    Language)	    database	    to	    keep	   track	   of	   constraints.	    	   • The	   online	   messaging	   system	   allowed	   all	   stakeholders	   to	   interact	   with	   IPS	   schedule.	    The	    system	    enabled	    viewing	    the	    schedules,	    maintain	    relevant	   information	   through	   the	   XML	   database	   and	   JavaBean	   applets.	   	   Figure	   20.

It	   had	   the	   Look-­‐ahead	    planning	    module,	    but	    was	    not	    developed	    as	    a	    complete	    production	   management	    system,	    which	    included	    phase	    planning	    and	    commitment	    planning.	   Also,	   it	   did	   not	   include	   product	   model	   (BIM)	   integration	   and	   did	   not	   involve	   the	   Last	   Planners	   in	   the	   process.	   4.7.5	   CONWIP	   (Sacks	   et	   al.,	   2009)	   and	   KanBIM	   4.7.5.1	    CONWIP:	    Sacks	    et	    al.	    (2009)	    developed	    a	    computerised	    system	    to	    enable	   pull	   flow	   scheduling	   based	   on	   visual	   processing	   signals	   that	   would	   be	   displayed	   on	   a	    board	    (a	    large	    computer	    screen).

The	   work	   statuses	   shown	   were	   tailored	   for	   each	   subcontractor	   to	   provide	   them	   visual	   information	   at	   a	   glance	   to	   help	   the	   plan	   and	   sequence	   the	   work	   in	   a	   more	   efficient	   way.	    	   	   	   Figure	   23.	   3D	   visualisation	   of	   past,	   present	   and	   future	   work	   using	   CONWIP	   (Sacks	   et	   al.,	   2009).	   4.7.5.2	   KanBIM	   Following	    from	    the	    CONWIP	    research,	    Sacks	    et	    al.	    (2010b)	    have	    developed	    a	   research	    framework	    and	    prototype	    called	    KanBIM.	    The	    main	    goal	    of	    KanBIM	   research	    is	    to	    propose,	    develop	    and	    test	    a	    BIM-­‐enabled	    system	    to	    support	   production	   planning	   and	   day-­‐to-­‐day	   production	   control	   on	   construction	   sites.	   They	   have	   specific	   a	   system	   based	   on	   initial	   analysis	   of	   literature	   in	   production	   control	   in	    construction	    and	    based	    on	    two	    case	    studies	    of	    construction	    management	   organisations	   in	   the	   UK.	   The	   KanBIM	   planning	   and	   control	   process	   is	   based	   on	   the	   Last	   Planner	   System™	   and	    allows	    phase	    planning,	    look-­‐ahead	    planning	    and	    commitment/weekly	   planning.	   However,	   it	   extends	   the	   system	   by	   also	   enabling	   daily	   work	   assignments	   in	   the	   field.	   There	   were	   a	   set	   of	   application	   mock-­‐up	   screens	   that	   were	   developed	   to	   demonstrate	   the	   functionality	   of	   the	   system.	   The	   concept	   has	   been	   developed	   by	   having	    the	    Building	    Information	    Model	    at	    the	    core	    of	    the	    system	    that	    provides	   product	   visualisation	   over	   which	   a	   number	   of	   task	   status	   graphics	   are	   displayed.	   The	    system	    also	    implements	    an	    automated	    work	    maturity	    index	    that	    calculates	   based	   on	   the	   status	   of	   resource	   availability/constraint	   status	   the	   maturity	   of	   any	   given	   task.	   The	   idea	   of	   having	   the	   maturity	   index	   is	   to	   support	   the	   decision	   making	   process	   while	   selecting/considering	   tasks	   for	   execution.	   Figure	   24	   and	   Figure	   25	   show	   various	   functionalities	   of	   the	   KanBIM	   system	   through	   mock-­‐ups.	   	   Figure	    24.

Trade	   crew	   leader	   work	   status	   and	   reporting	   interface	   in	   KanBIM	   (Sacks	   et	   al.,	   2010b).	   It	   would	   be	   important	   to	   note	   that	   there	   has	   been	   initial	   collaboration	   between	   the	   VisiLean	    research	    and	    KanBIM,	    however	    they	    are	    two	    separate	    systems	    with	   completely	   different	   system	   architecture	   and	   workflow.	   It	   was	   found	   early	   by	   both	   teams	   that	   their	   research	   idea	   coincide	   significantly	   and	   both	   emerged	   almost	   at	   the	    same	    time.	    Around	    the	    same	    time	    the	    both	    projects	    initiated	    the	    leading	   researchers	    from	    both	    teams	    collaborated	    to	    carry	    out	    seminar	    research	    by	   developing	    a	    conceptual	    framework	    between	    the	    interaction	    between	    Lean	   Construction	    and	    BIM	    which	    is	    discussed	    in	    the	    following	    section.	    Beginning	    in	   2009,	    four	    collaborative	    workshops	    were	    organise	    in	    the	    course	    of	    the	    next	    1.5	   years,	   where	   significant	   exchange	   of	   ideas	   took	   place.	   It	   should	   be	   noted	   that	   these	   exchanges	    have	    influenced	    and	    informed	    the	    early	    research	    carried	    out	    in	    both	   KanBIM	   and	   VisiLean	   systems.	   However,	   due	   to	   the	   lack	   of	   any	   joint	   funding,	   the	   actual	    development	    of	    prototypes	    and	    further	    research	    including	    pilot	   implementations	   and	   demonstrations	   were	   organised	   individually.	    	   Although	   there	   was	   no	   formal	   agreement	   or	   division	   of	   work,	   the	   VisiLean	   system	   dealt	    with	    the	    collaborative	    planning	    workflow	    and	    developing	    a	    production	   planning	   and	   scheduling	   system	   that	   would	   form	   the	   backbone	   (and	   the	   backend)	   of	   the	   overall	   production	   system,	   whereas	   the	   KanBIM	   system	   focussed	   on	   the	   field	   based	   activities,	   daily	   monitoring	   and	   progress	   of	   the	   production	   management	   and	   control	    system.	    However,	    it	    should	    be	    noted	    that	    there	    is	    some	    overlap	    in	    the	   functionalities	    and	    overall	    concept	    between	    both	    the	    systems,	    and	    that	    they	    are	   complementary	   to	   each	   other.	   Both,	    the	    CONWIP	    and	    KanBIM	    concepts	    represent	    an	    integrated	    production	   management	    system	    enabling	    visual	    product	    and	    process	    visualisation	    through	   Lean	    &	    BIM.	    The	    system	    covers	    all	    three	    aspect	    of	    the	    production	    system,	   transformation,	    flow	    and	    value	    and	    provides	    a	    comprehensive	    research	   framework.	   At	   the	   centre	   of	   both	   production	   management	   system	   is	   the	   concept	   of	   “pull”	    flow	    mechanism.	    It	    also	    supports	    collaboration	    between	    the	    construction	   team	    and	    are	    highly	    visual	    in	    nature.	    As	    mentioned	    above,	    both	    KanBIM	    and	   VisiLean	    research	    were	    contemporary	    and	    collaborative	    in	    nature,	    as	    a	    result	   VisiLean	   extends	   and	   complements	   both	   these	   research	   initiatives.	   This	   aspect	   is	   discussed	    further	    in	    Chapter	    5	    where	    VisiLean	    design	    and	    development	    are	   described.	    	   4.8	   Conceptual	   framework	   –	   BIM	   and	   Lean	    	   Sacks	    et	    al.	    (2010a)	    have	    developed	    a	    conceptual	    analysis	    framework,	    which	   provides	    a	    mechanism	    to	    analyse	    the	    interaction	    between	    BIM	    and	    lean	   construction	   principles.	   The	   author	   was	   part	   of	   this	   research	   and	   co-­‐author	   in	   the	   paper.	    This	    research	    laid	    the	    conceptual	    foundation	    for	    the	    VisiLean	    research,	   hence	    is	    important	    from	    that	    perspective.	    Here	    the	    authors	    have	    identified	    56	   unique	    interactions	    between	    BIM	    functions	    and	    lean	    principles.	    The	    authors	    list	   key	   lean	   principles	   (and	   sub	   principles)	   that	   were	   selected	   for	   analysis	   as	   outlined	   below	   in	   Table	   12.	   	   		   Table	   12.

The	   bare	   matrix	   provides	   a	   framework	   for	   analysis	   of	   the	   interactions	   between	    Lean	    and	    BIM.	    The	    nature	    of	    interaction	    in	    any	    cell	    could	    be	    either	   positive	   or	   negative,	   representing	   synergy	   or	   inhibiting	   characteristics.	   Subsequently,	   the	   matrix	   was	   populated	   with	   possible	   interactions	   between	   Lean	   and	   BIM	   and	   empirical	   evidence	   to	   support	   or	   refute	   the	   interaction	   was	   sought.	   56	   unique	   interactions	   as	   shown	   in	   Table	   15	   were	   found	   on	   the	   basis	   of	   emerging	   evidence	    from	    research	    and	    practice.	    Anecdotal	    evidence	    was	    found	    for	    most	    of	   interactions.	    It	    was	    identified	    that	    these	    interactions	    are	    not	    just	    limited	    to	    the	   design	    phase	    (where	    BIM	    technology	    is	    predominantly	    being	    applied	    currently)	   but	   extend	   to	   the	   production	   phase.	   All	   three	   interactions	   noted	   above	   either	   span	   the	   entire	   lifecycle	   of	   the	   project	   or	   address	   specifically	   the	   production	   phase.	   For	   example,	   	reducing	   	product	   	production	   	(process)	   	variability	   	and	   	reducing	   production	   cycle	   duration	   are	   all	   key	   from	   production	   management	   perspective.	   Similarly,	   the	   BIM	   functions	   with	   highest	   concentration	   of	   unique	   interactions	   are:	   • “Aesthetic”	   and	   functional	   evaluation	   • Multiuser	   viewing	   of	   merged	   or	   separate	   multidiscipline	   models	   • 4D	   visualisation	   of	   construction	   schedules	   and	   • Online	   communication	   of	   product	   and	   process	   information	   It	    can	    be	    observed	    that	    three	    out	    the	    four	    of	    the	    functions	    noted	    above	    are	   concerned	    with	    fabrication	    and	    construction	    management,	    indicating	    a	    strong	   synergy	   of	   Lean	   and	   BIM	   during	   the	   production	   phase.

Lean	    &	    BIM	    Interactions	    –	    Explanation	    of	    cell	    content	    (Sacks	    et	    al.,	   2010a).	   Index Explanation 1.  Due to better appreciation of design at an early stage, and also due to the early functional evaluation of design against performance requirements (such as energy, acoustics, wind, thermal, etc) the quality of the end product is higher and more consistent with design intent. This reduces variability commonly introduced by late client-initiated changes during the construction stage. 2.  Building modeling imposes a rigour on designers in that flaws or incompletely detailed parts are easily observed or caught in clash checking or other automated checking. This improves design quality, preventing designers from ‘making-do’ (Koskela 2004) and reducing rework in the field as a result of incomplete design. 3.  Building systems are becoming increasingly complex. Even trained professionals have difficulty generating accurate mental models with drawings alone. BIM simplifies the task of understanding designs, which helps construction planners deal with complex products. 4.  As all aspects of design are captured in a 3D model the client can easily understand, the requirements can be captured and communicated in a thorough way already during the concept development stage. This can also empower more project stakeholders to participate in design decision making. 5.  Virtual prototyping and simulation due to the intelligence built in the model objects enables automated checking against design and building regulations, which in turn makes verification and validation of the design more efficient. 6.  With BIM, Gemba can be augmented because it is now possible to virtually visit the project and the worksite. With objects that contain intelligence and parametric information, problem solving is also more efficient. 7.  BIM provides the ability to evaluate the impact of design changes on construction in a visual manner that is not possible with traditional 2D drawings. Rapid manipulation is a key enabler for repetition of this kind of analysis for multiple design alternatives (see also item 40). 8.  It is now possible for multi-skilled teams to work concurrently in order to generate various design alternatives at an early stage using integration platforms such as Navisworks, Solibri, Tekla etc. as exemplified by the Castro Valley project case study (Khemlani, 2009). Also, at a later stage during manufacturing/construction; for any design change, changing the model will automatically update other relevant information such as cost estimating, project planning, production drawings, etc. 9.  Testing the design against performance criteria ensures that the design is appropriate for the chosen function, reducing the variability and improving the performance of the end product. 10.  Automated quantity take off which is linked to the BIM model is more accurate as there are less chances of human error; hence it improves flow by reducing variability. Also, changing the design at a later stage also changes the linked quantity files; this ensures that the quantities are always accurate. 11.  In sets of 2D drawings and specifications, the same objects are represented in multiple places. As design progresses and changes are made, operators must maintain consistency between the multiple representations/information views. BIM removes this problem entirely by using a single representation of information from which all reports are derived automatically. 12.  Use of software capable of model integration (such as Solibri/Navisworks/Tekla) to Index Explanation merge models, identify clashes, and resolve them through iterative refinement of the different discipline specific models results in almost error free installation on site. 13.  Multi-disciplinary review of design and of fabrication detailing, including clash-checking, enables early identification of design issues.  14.  Automated task generation for planning helps avoid human errors such as omission of tasks or work stages. 15.  Discrete event simulation can be used to test and improve production processes and to run virtual first-run studies, which in construction are often impossible or impractical. 16.  At the conceptual design stage, rapid turnaround to prepare cost estimates and other performance evaluations enables evaluation of multiple design options, including the use of multi-objective optimization procedures (such as genetic algorithms). 17.  Animations of production or installation sequences can be prepared. These guide workers in how to perform work in specific contexts, and are an excellent means for ensuring that standardized procedures are followed, particularly where turnover of workers from stage to stage is high, as is common in construction. 18.  When up-to-date product information is available online, the opportunities for identifying conflicts and errors within short cycle-times, when their impact is limited, are enhanced. 19.  Direct transfer of fabrication instructions to numerically-controlled machinery, such as automated steel or rebar fabrication, eliminates opportunities for human error in transcribing information. 20.  Direct delivery of information removes waiting time, thus improving flow. 21.  Provision of a model background and context for scanning bar codes or RFID tags, and display of the process data on model backgrounds, enables accurate reporting and rapid response to work flow problems 22.  Quick turn-around of structural, thermal, acoustic performance analyses; of cost estimation; and of evaluation of conformance to client program, all enable collaborative design, collapsing cycle times for building design and detailing. 23.  Parallel processing on multiple workstations in a coordinated fashion (with locking of elements edited on each machine) collapses cycle times of otherwise serial design activities. Where design was previously (i.e. with CAD) performed in parallel on different parts, the time needed for integration and coordination of the different model views is removed. 24.  Model-based coordination between disciplines (including clash-checking) is automated and so requires a fraction of the time needed for coordination using CAD overlays. 25.  All three functions serve to reduce cycle time during construction itself because they result in optimized operational schedules, with fewer conflicts 26.  Where process status is visualized through a BIM model, such as in the KanBIM system (Sacks et al. 2009), series of consecutive activities required to complete a building space can be performed one after the other with little delay between them. This shortens cycle time for any given space or assembly. 27.  Direct computer-controlled machinery fed directly from a model can help shorten cycle times by eliminating labour-intensive data entry and/or manual production, thus shortening cycle times. This does not guarantee shortened cycle times if the time gained is then wasted through batching or waiting. 28.  Removal of data processing steps for ordering or renewing material deliveries, removal of time wasted before ordering, etc., improve cycle times. 29.  In this case the functionality can be said to increase inventory of design alternatives. This can be considered beneficial in terms of making broader selections, delaying selection of Index Explanation a single alternative until the last responsible moment. 30.  Online visualization and management of process can help implement production strategies designed to reduce work-in-process inventories and production batch sizes (number of spaces in process by a specific trade at any given time), as in the KanBIM approach. 31.  Automated generation of tasks for a given model scenario and project status drastically reduces the setup time needed for any new computation or evaluation of a construction schedule alternative from any point forward. 32.  For numerically controlled machinery, data entry represents setup time. Direct electronic communication of process instructions from a model essentially eliminates this setup time, making single piece runs viable. 33.  Design coordination between multiple design models using an integrated model viewer in a collaborative work environment, such as those described in Liston et al. (2001) and Khanzode et al. (2006), enables design teams to bring multi-disciplinary knowledge and skills to bear in a parallel process. 34.  Process visualization and online communication of process status are key elements in allowing production teams to prioritize their subsequent work locations in terms of their potential contribution to ensuring a continuous subsequent flow of work that completes spaces, thus implementing a pull flow. This is central to the KanBIM approach, which extends the Last Planner System. 35.  Where BIM systems are integrated with supply chain partner databases, they provide a powerful mechanism for communicating signals to pull production and delivery of materials and product design information. This also helps make the supply chain transparent. 36.  Multiple users working on the same model simultaneously enables sharing of the workload evenly between operators. 37.  Discrete event simulation can reveal uneven work allocations and support assessment of work assignments to level production. 38.  Online access to production standards, product data and company protocols helps institutionalize standard work practices by making them readily available, and within context, to work teams at the work face. This relies, however, on provision of practical means for workers to access online information. 39.  Where BIM interfaces provide a context for real time status reporting, measuring performance becomes accurate and feasible. Measurement of performance within a system where work is standardized and documented is central to process improvement. 40.  BIM provides an ideal visualization environment for the project throughout the design and construction stage and enables simulation of production methods, temporary equipment and processes. Modeling and animation of construction sequences in ‘4D’ tools provides a unique opportunity to visualize construction processes, for identifying resource conflicts in time and space and resolving constructability issues. This enables process optimization improving efficiency and safety and can help identify bottlenecks and improve flow. 41.  Detailed planning and generation of multiple fine-grained alternatives can be said to increase complexity rather than simplify management. 42.  None of these applications can be considered mature technology. 43.  Where clients or end-users are engaged in simultaneous reviews of different system design alternatives they can more easily identify conflicts between their requirements and the functionality the proposed systems will provide. 44.  Rapid generation of production plan alternatives can allow selection among them to be Index Explanation delayed (making the last responsible moment later than it would be otherwise). This can be considered to be a set-based approach to production system design and to production planning. 45.  Online access helps to bring the most up-to-date design information to the work face (although it cannot guarantee that the design information reflects the user requirements). 46.  Clash-checking and solving other integration issues verifies and validates product information 47.  Visualization of proposed schedules and visualization of on-going processes verifies and validates process information. 48.  Where managers can ‘see’ process status with near to real-time resolution, this may substitute for the need to see processes directly on site. However, it cannot substitute for seeing a process with one’s own eyes. 49.  These functions can support and facilitate participatory decision making by providing more and better information to all involved and by expanding the range of options that can be considered. Of course, they cannot in and of themselves guarantee that senior management will adopt a consensus building approach. 50.  Integration of different companies’ logistic and other information systems makes working relationships that extend beyond individual projects worthwhile and desirable. 51.  Use and re-use of design models to set up analysis models (such as energy, acoustics, wind, thermal, etc) reduces setup time and makes it possible to run more varied and more detailed analyses.  52.  Abuse of the ease with which drawings can be generated can lead to more versions of drawings and other information reports than are needed being prepared and printed, unnecessarily increasing drawing inventories. 53.  Automated generation of drawings, especially shop drawings for fabrication (of steel or precast, for example) enables review and production to be performed in smaller batches because the information can be provided on demand. 54.  Automated drawing generation greatly improves engineering capacity when compared with 2D drafting, and it is a more reliable technology because it produces properly coordinated drawings sets. 55.  Animations of production or installation sequences can be prepared. These guide workers in how to perform work in specific contexts, and are an excellent means for ensuring that standardized procedures are followed, particularly where turnover of workers from stage to stage is high, as is common in construction. 56.  Sharing models among all participants of a project team enhances communication at the design phase even without producing drawings, helping ensure that the requirements are understood and transmitted throughout the team and on to builders and suppliers 4.9	   Summary	   of	   BIM	   Building	    Information	    Modelling	    is	    a	    product	    management	    solution	    that	    has	    a	   potential	    to	    not	    only	    address	    the	    technological	    issues	    but	    also	    process	    and	   people	   issues.	   It	   covers	   the	   entire	   building	   lifecycle,	   from	   conceptual	   design	   to	   construction	    and	    hand	    over	    and	    facilities	    maintenance.	    There	    are	    specific	   functions	   within	   the	   production	   management	   aspect	   of	   construction,	   which	   are	   well	   served	   by	   BIM,	   such	   as	   simulation	   of	   a	   construction	   plan,	   or	   checking	   for	   physical	    and	    process	    related	    clashes.	    Also,	    having	    a	    visual	    representation	    of	    a	   product	    model	    while	    constructing	    improves	    the	    understanding	    of	    the	   construction	   team	   from	   constructability	   perspective	   and	   reduces	   the	   chances	   for	   errors.	   Overall,	   BIM	   has	   a	   potential	   to	   reduce	   many	   inefficiencies	   attributed	   to	   the	   two	   dimensional	   design	   methods.	    	   However,	   when	   combined,	   lean	   construction	   and	   BIM	   have	   even	   higher	   potential	   to	   address	   the	   shortcomings	   within	   the	   construction	   process	   as	   discussed	   in	   the	   sections	   above.	   This	   synergy	   of	   lean	   and	   BIM	   has	   the	   potential	   to	   address	   specific	   problems	   faced	   by	   the	   production	   management	   in	   construction	   and	   is	   considered	   further	   in	   the	   discussion	   below.	   4.10	   Discussion	   and	   Identifying	   Opportunities	   for	   a	   Solution	   As	   discussed	   in	   Chapter	   4,	   the	   problems	   associated	   with	   the	   construction	   process	   can	    be	    classified	    in	    two	    major	    categories:	    problems	    with	    the	    construction	   process	    and	    problems	    with	    the	    product	    representation	    (i.e.	    what	    is	    to	    be	   constructed).	    Also,	    as	    discussed	    in	    Chapter	    3,	    currently	    available	    information	   systems	   for	   construction	   only	   address	   the	   peripheral	   processes	   and	   not	   the	   core	   construction	   process,	   which	   reduce	   their	   effectiveness	   (Koskela	   and	   Kazi,	   2003).	   To	   improve	   the	   efficiency	   of	   the	   overall	   construction	   process,	   both	   the	   process	   and	   the	   product	   representation	   have	   to	   be	   efficient	   in	   their	   individual	   capacity	   as	   well	    as	    in	    an	    integrated	    capacity.	    Limitations	    of	    the	    traditional	    “T”	    based	   processes	    in	    construction	    such	    as	    CPM	    along	    with	    the	    limitations	    of	    2D	    based	   product	   representation	   tools	   such	   as	   2D	   Computer	   Aided	   Design	   were	   discussed.	    	   As	   discussed,	   the	   lean	   production	   management	   system	   offers	   an	   effective	   way	   to	   solve	   the	   process	   related	   problems	   as	   it	   is	   based	   on	   the	   improved	   “TFV”	   theory.	   However,	   it	   only	   solves	   a	   partial	   problem,	   i.e.	   the	   problem	   related	   with	   process.	   Tools	    such	    as	    Visual	    Management,	    offer	    simple	    yet	    effective	    method	    of	   communicating	    production	    related	    requirements	    to	    workers.	    Building	   Information	   Modelling	   (BIM)	   systems	   through	   an	   improved	   product	   model,	   solve	   many	    of	    the	    problems	    associated	    with	    product	    visualisation.	    BIM	    also	    offers	    a	   solution	   to	   overcome	   many	   process	   related	   issues	   as	   it	   provides	   an	   intelligent	   product	   model	   that	   resides	   in	   a	   visual	   platform.	   BIM	   can	   also	   be	   seen	   as	   a	   virtual	   Visual	   Management	   platform	   for	   the	   production	   management	   process.	   The	    efficiency	    of	    the	    production	    planning	    and	    control	    process	    in	    construction	   depends	    significantly	    on	    the	    reliability	    and	    timely	    availability	    of	    resource	   information.	   However,	   this	   information	   is	   not	   readily	   available	   due	   to	   the	   lack	   of	   systems	   integration	   that	   prevails	   within	   the	   industry.	    	   As	    observed,	    current	    implementations	    of	    the	    LPS™	    mostly	    rely	    on	    the	    team	   leaders’	    and	    foreman’s	    ability	    to	    gather	    required	    information	    for	    the	    weekly	   planning	   meetings	   and	   also	   for	   the	   look-­‐ahead	   planning.	   However,	   much	   time	   is	   wasted	    chasing	    relevant	    information	    due	    to	    the	    lack	    of	    a	    production	   management	   system.	   There	   is	   a	   gap	   in	   the	   market/field	   as	   the	   lean	   construction	   processes	   are	   not	   effectively	   supported	   by	   the	   Information	   Systems,	   even	   though	   much	   of	   the	   project	   information	   now	   exists	   electronically.	   The	   current	   3D	   and	   4D	   BIM	   systems	   that	   provide	   a	   master	   plan	   level	   overview	   of	   the	   project,	   the	   true	   capabilities	   of	   Building	   Information	   Modelling	   systems	   are	   not	   exploited	   enough	   during	   the	   production	   management	   stages.	    	   The	   conceptual	   Lean	   and	   BIM	   framework	   clearly	   demonstrated	   the	   potential	   for	   these	   two	   initiatives	   during	   the	   production	   management	   stages,	   which	   have	   also	   been	   proven	   through	   previous	   case	   studies.	    The	   existing	   research	   in	   Lean	   and	   BIM	   production	   management	   systems	   also	   demonstrate	   the	   potential,	   however,	   with	    the	    exception	    of	    KanBIM	    none	    extend	    to	    field	    or	    provide	    support	    for	    the	   Lean	   Construction	   workflow.	    	   Subsequently,	   from	   the	   literature	   review	   and	   industry	   feedback,	   it	   emerges	   that	   there	   is	   a	   distinct	   potential	   for	   a	   system	   that	   can	   integrate	   lean	   construction	   to	   Building	    Information	    Modelling	    systems.	    The	    interest	    of	    construction	   organisations	    in	    BIM	    is	    increasing.	    This	    view	    is	    supported	    by	    the	    BIM	   SMartMarket	    report	    (2009),	    where	    findings	    suggest	    that	    the	    percentage	    of	   contractors	   who	   use	   BIM	   is	   expected	   to	   rise	   from	   11%	   to	   54%	   by	   2012,	   as	   they	   perceive	   BIM	   as	   a	   valuable	   tool.	   At	   the	   same	   time	   the	   use	   of	   BIM	   on	   construction	   sites	   is	   also	   increasing.	   However,	   the	   construction	   organisations	   are	   constrained	   by	    the	    limitation	    of	    available	    BIM	    solutions	    that	    support	    on-­‐site	    construction	   activities.	   This	   view	   was	   also	   reflected	   in	   the	   BIM	   SmartMarket	   report	   (2009),	   where	   54%	   contractors	   said	   that	   they	   use	   BIM	   on	   11%	   of	   projects	   and	   expect	   that	   number	   to	   increase	   to	   only	   30%	   by	   2012.	   Overall,	   it	   emerges	   that	   there	   is	   a	   need	   for	   a	   software	   system	   that	   would	   support	   site	   based	   construction	   activities,	   especially	   by	   integrating	   lean	   and	   BIM.
5	   Designing	   and	   Developing	   VisiLean:	   A	   Production	   Management	   System	   From	   the	   discussion	   in	   Chapters	   3	   and	   4,	   it	   emerges	   that	   there	   is	   a	   clear	   need	   for	   a	   software	   system	   that	   supports	   the	   full	   production	   management	   lifecycle.	   Such	   a	   system	   would	   support	   the	   lean	   production	   management	   workflow	   on	   the	   job	   site	   itself	   and	   would	   be	   designed	   to	   support	   the	   production	   crew/site	   teams	   (i.e.	   the	   Last	    Planners).	    The	    system	    will	    primarily	    address	    two	    major	    strands	    of	    the	   production	   system:	   • Production	   management	   process	   representation	   • Product	   representation	   and	   visualisation	   Additionally	   there	   are	   further	   requirements	   to	   support	   the	    	   • Integration	    of	    resource	    information	    (such	    as	    procurement,	    inventory,	   personnel,	   etc.),	   • Communication	   between	   operatives	   and	    	   • Delivery	   of	   accurate	   reports	   to	   facilitate	   better	   decision-­‐making.	    	   A	    conceptual	    research	    framework	    and	    a	    prototype	    based	    on	    that	    framework	   have	   been	   designed	   and	   developed	   during	   this	   research.	   This	   Chapter	   describes	   the	   design	   and	   development	   of	   the	   framework	   and	   the	   prototype.	   This	   Chapter	   is	   divided	   in	   two	   main	   parts,	   namely:	   i. Designing	   the	   framework	   –	   this	   section	   describes	   the	   key	   requirements	   gathered	    from	    the	    field	    (through	    interviews,	    workshops	    and	    meetings)	   and	   from	   previous	   research.	    	   ii. Developing	    the	    prototype	    –	    this	    section	    describes	    the	    development	   methodology,	   functional	   requirements,	   system	   architecture	   and	   the	   steps	   taken	   to	   develop	   the	   VisiLean	   software	   system.	   5.1	   Designing	   the	   framework	   The	   framework	   and	   the	   prototype	   developed	   are	   designed	   to	   support	   the	   lean	   production	    planning	    and	    control	    method	    that	    is	    based	    on	    the	    Last	    Planner™	   method	   of	   production	   planning	   and	   control.	   An	   explanation	   of	   the	   Last	   Planner™	   workflow	   has	   been	   provided	   in	   section	   4.2.1.	    	   While	   designing	   the	   framework,	   the	   following	   process	   was	   followed:	   i. Gathering	   feedback	   from	   practitioners	   regarding	   current	   practice	   in	   use	   of	   Lean	   and	   BIM	   in	   production	   management	   ii. Gathering	   general	   production	   management	   requirements	   from	   literature	   iii. Gathering	   and	   analysing	   requirements	   from	   previous	   research	   initiatives	   in	   advanced	   visualisation	   techniques	   in	   production	   management	   iv. Defining	   a	   set	   of	   requirements	   for	   a	   production	   management	   system	   Before	    initiating	    the	    design	    of	    the	    solution	    to	    any	    problem,	    it	    is	    necessary	    to	   understand	    the	    problem	    in	    its	    proper	    context	    and	    then	    define	    the	    key	   requirements.	   In	   previous	   Chapters,	   the	   main	   problems	   being	   faced	   during	   the	   production	   management	   stage	   of	   construction	   were	   discussed.	   However,	   for	   the	   sake	    of	    clarity	    the	    key	    problems	    of	    the	    production	    management	    system	    in	   construction	   are	   summarised	   as	   below:	   i. Absence	    of	    production	    management	    system	    that	    support	    the	    “Pull”	   workflow	   ii. No	   support	   for	   detailed	   constraints	   analysis	   and	   collaborative	   analysis	   of	   the	   plan	   iii. Lack	   of	   integration	   of	   other	   information	   sources	   such	   as	   procurement	   and	   design	   management	   iv. Lack	   of	   audit	   trail	   of	   decision	   making	   during	   scheduling	   v. Lack	   of	   integration	   with	   the	   product	   model	   (BIM)	   vi. Problems	   regarding	   spatial	   awareness	   during	   planning/execution	   (due	   to	   the	   use	   of	   2D	   drawings)	   To	    gain	    deeper	    understanding	    into	    the	    problems	    faced	    by	    the	    construction	   personnel	    during	    the	    production	    planning	    and	    control	    stage,	    feedback	    was	   gathered	   through	   workshops,	   focus	   group	   interviews.	   Further	   feedback	   was	   also	   received	    during	    the	    demonstration	    of	    the	    prototype,	    which	    improved	    the	   understanding	   of	   the	   problem.	   5.1.1	   Gathering	   Feedback	   from	   Practitioners	    	   In	    addition	    to	    feedback	    received	    during	    workshops	    and	    demonstrations,	   feedback	   was	   also	   gathered	   during	   a	   pilot	   project,	   which	   was	   carried	   out	   on	   a	   Highway	    Automation	    project	    (where	    traffic	    management	    infrastructure	    were	   being	   installed)	   in	   the	   UK.	    	   Although	   the	   workshops	   and	   meetings	   did	   not	   follow	   a	   structured	   questionnaire	   approach	    and	    were	    mostly	    open-­‐ended	    discussions,	    where	    possible	    following	   questions	   were	   asked	   while	   gathering	   feedback.	   • What	    challenges	    are	    being	    faced	    (technical	    and	    process	    related)	    while	   implementing	   the	   production	   management	   system	   • What	    BIM	    solutions	    are	    being	    used	    to	    support	    the	    production	   management	   system	   • Are	    you	    using	    Lean	    Production	    Management	    techniques	    on	    your	   project(s)?	   o If	   so,	   do	   you	   think	   they	   are	   adequately	   supported	   through	   existing	   Information	   Systems?	   • Do	   you	   use	   BIM	   on	   your	   projects?	   o If	    so,	    are	    you	    using	    BIM	    for	    production	    management	    and	    to	   support	   lean	   processes?	   The	   following	   paragraphs	   outline	   the	   main	   feedback	   received	   during	   the	   initial	   feedback	   sessions.	    	   5.1.1.1	    Production	    management	    systems	    mostly	    rely	    on	    manual	    information	   retrieval	   Even	   after	   almost	   two	   decades	   following	   the	   launch	   of	   International	   Group	   for	   Lean	   Construction	   and	   numerous	   construction	   organisations	   around	   the	   world	   having	   adopted	   lean	   practices,	   hardly	   any	   software	   systems	   exist	   that	   specifically	   support	    the	    lean	    production	    process.	    Collaborative	    planning	    sessions,	    namely	   reverse	    phase	    scheduling,	    look-­‐ahead	    planning	    and	    weekly/commitment	   planning	   rely	   mostly	   on	   manual	   processes	   where	   stakeholders	   use	   Post	   It™	   notes	   or	   similar	   devices	   to	   plan	   and	   sequence	   construction	   activities.	   Following	   from	   the	    planning	    sessions,	    the	    information	    is	    mostly	    managed	    using	    paper	    based	   plans	   or	   at	   most	   Excel	   spread	   sheets	   or	   similar	   systems.	    	   Observed	   by	   the	   author,	   on	   two	   UK	   based	   projects	   where	   collaborative	   planning	   was	   implemented,	   besides	   following	   the	   Post	   It™	   method,	   five	   separate	   spread	   sheets	   were	   being	   maintained,	   along	   with	   three	   paper	   based	   registers	   to	   collect	   and	   manage	   information	   from	   the	   planning	   meetings.	   This	   was	   in	   addition	   of	   the	   project	    planning	    and	    scheduling	    system	    Primavera	    Project	    Planner,	    and	   Enterprise	    Information	    Management	    system.	    None	    of	    these	    systems	    were	   integrated	   with	   each	   other	   causing	   a	   significant	   amount	   of	   data	   re-­‐entry.	   Use	   of	   such	   a	   system	   is	   inefficient	   as	   it	   cannot	   easily	   integrate	   information	   from	   other	   management	   systems	   and	   is	   not	   standardised	   across	   projects.	   Another	    key	    issue	    that	    was	    highlighted	    by	    the	    practitioners	    was	    that	    little	   auditing	   is	   possible	   with	   the	   current	   systems,	   i.e.	   when	   key	   decisions	   are	   made	   regarding	    (re)	    scheduling	    tasks,	    reallocating	    resources,	    etc.,	    it	    is	    currently	    not	   possible	    to	    record	    such	    decisions.	    Hence,	    it	    is	    not	    possible	    to	    track	    the	   performance	   of	   the	   project	   and	   link	   back	   to	   these	   decisions	   and	   learn	   from	   it	   (i.e.	   whether	   it	   impacted	   positively	   or	   negatively).	   Similarly,	   reports	   such	   as	   the	   PPC	   (Percentage	    Plan	    Complete)	    and	    Reasons	    for	    Non	    Completion	    are	    created	   manually	   either	   by	   the	   site	   manager	   or	   by	   the	   site	   planner.	   The	   data	   is	   collected	   manually	    and	    such	    reports	    are	    prepared	    in	    Excel.	    Such	    tasks	    are	    very	    time	   consuming	   and	   as	   a	   result	   costly.	   5.1.1.2	   Use	   of	   BIM	   is	   still	   limited	   to	   Clash	   Detection	   and	   4D	    	   It	   was	   observed	   through	   all	   interviews	   and	   workshops	   that	   the	   participants	   felt	   that	   the	   availability	   of	   BIM	   model	   provides	   them	   a	   significant	   opportunity	   to	   use	   it	   throughout	   the	   construction	   project.	   Although	   use	   of	   BIM	   is	   increasing	   on	   the	   construction	   site,	   it	   is	   still	   limited	   to	   basic	   4D	   simulation	   where	   a	   master	   plan	   is	   attached	   to	   the	   model	   and	   the	   project	   schedule	   can	   be	   simulated	   in	   3D	   at	   a	   macro	   level.	   There	   are	   some	   systems,	   which	   enable	   detailed	   resource	   management	   and	   5D	    planning,	    however	    these	    systems	    are	    highly	    complicated	    and	    rely	    on	   dedicated	   system	   operatives	   who	   have	   been	   trained	   to	   use	   these	   systems.	   Due	   to	   this	    high	    level	    of	    training	    and	    skill	    required	    and	    relatively	    high	    cost	    of	   implementation,	    it	    is	    not	    possible	    to	    yet	    implement	    these	    systems	    across	    the	   whole	    supply	    chain	    so	    that	    they	    can	    be	    used	    throughout	    the	    construction	   process.	   As	   a	   result,	   these	   are	   mostly	   used	   during	   the	   initial	   stages	   of	   the	   project	   to	    develop	    detailed	    schedules,	    but	    not	    during	    the	    production	    management	   operations.	   It	   emerged	   from	   the	   interviews	   that	   two	   organisations	   were	   already	   using	   BIM	   during	    their	    collaborative	    planning	    sessions.	    However,	    this	    was	    achieved	    by	   having	    a	    dedicated	    BIM	    manager	    who	    helped	    with	    the	    navigation	    of	    the	    BIM	   model	    while	    the	    tasks	    are	    being	    discussed	    during	    the	    collaborative	    planning	   session.	   When	   these	   BIM	   managers	   were	   interviewed,	   it	   was	   mentioned	   that	   due	   to	   the	   lack	   of	   direct	   connection	   between	   the	   planning	   tasks	   and	   BIM	   system,	   the	   navigation	    becomes	    a	    difficult	    activity	    and	    sometimes	    results	    in	    longer	    than	   usual	   time	   taken	   to	   carry	   out	   these	   meetings.	   5.1.1.3	    Field	    BIM	    is	    now	    increasingly	    becoming	    accessible	    due	    to	    advanced	   hardware	   and	   maturing/new	   software	   Use	   of	   BIM	   technology	   on	   construction	   sites	   is	   increasing	   due	   to	   the	   advantages	   that	   it	   provides	   such	   as	   physical	   and	   process	   clash	   detection	   as	   well	   as	   clarity	   on	   the	    design	    intent.	    Some	    case	    studies	    such	    as	    Castro	    Valley	    project	    (Khemlani,	   2009)	   and	   Maryland	   General	   Hospital	   (Eastman	   et	   al.,	   2011)	   are	   such	   examples	   where	    BIM	    has	    been	    utilised	    quite	    successfully	    along	    with	    other	    tools	    and	   techniques	   such	   as	   lean	   construction.	   In	   two	   case	   studies	   the	   author	   observed,	   one	   in	   Chicago,	   US	   and	   other	   in	   Bristol,	   UK,	   it	   was	   found	   that	   a	   workstation	   (high	   end	   computer)	   was	   made	   available	   to	   construction	   teams	   to	   access	   BIM	   models	   during	    execution.	    This	    enabled	    the	    workers	    to	    gain	    a	    better	    understanding	    of	   what	   is	   to	   be	   constructed	   (i.e.	   task	   at	   hand)	   and	   reduced	   the	   need	   for	   supervisory	   communication.	   However,	   as	   the	   BIM	   models	   are	   only	   the	   partial	   representation	   of	   the	   project	   (i.e.	   only	   the	   product	   model),	   the	   process	   side	   was	   not	   available	   in	   the	   same	   interface.	   It	    was	    also	    found	    that	    construction	    companies	    were	    looking	    for	    innovative	   solutions	   to	   take	   BIM	   to	   the	   worksite	   using	   mobile	   technologies,	   however	   were	   restricted	   by	   the	   options	   available	   to	   them.	   There	   are	   currently	   only	   a	   couple	   of	   software	   platforms	   such	   as	   Vela	   systems	   (now	   acquired	   by	   Autodesk)	   and	   Artra	   (in	   the	   UK)	   that	   offer	   field	   management	   of	   construction	   using	   mobile	   devices	   and	   also	   partial	   integration	   with	   BIM	   model.	   5.1.1.4	   Summary	   of	   feedback	   Although	   the	   popularity	   of	   BIM	   is	   increasing	   on	   construction	   projects,	   from	   the	   user	    workshops	    and	    interviews,	    it	    was	    found	    that	    not	    many	    software	    systems	   exist	   that	   go	   beyond	   macro	   level	   4D	   planning.	   Hence,	   construction	   personnel	   are	   left	    to	    devise	    their	    individual	    solutions	    on	    their	    own.	    In	    case	    of	    some	   organisations,	    they	    hire	    a	    trained	    BIM	    technician	    or	    architect	    to	    personally	   facilitate	    use	    of	    BIM	    during	    daily	    construction	    activities	    and	    other	    planning	   sessions,	   however,	   this	   is	   yet	   to	   become	   an	   industry	   wide	   practice,	   and	   one	   that	   is	   not	   yet	   supported	   by	   commercially	   (or	   otherwise)	   available	   systems.	   5.1.2	   Gathering	   general	   production	   management	   requirements	   In	    the	    following	    section,	    the	    key	    requirements	    for	    a	    production	    management	   system	   are	   outlined,	   which	   are	   classified	   under	   two	   main	   categories,	   functional	   and	   technical.	    	   As	    such,	    the	    lean	    production	    management	    workflow	    as	    a	    whole	    has	    to	    be	   supported	   by	   the	   proposed	   framework	   and	   system,	   which	   forms	   the	   major	   part	   of	   the	   functional	   requirements.	   Additionally,	   there	   are	   requirements	   to	   support	   the	    sharing	    of	    information	    internally	    within	    the	    processes	    and	    externally	    to	   members	   of	   the	   construction/production	   team	   (that	   form	   part	   of	   the	   implicit	   and	   explicit	   communication).	   Also,	   there	   are	   requirements	   for	   the	   user	   interface	   that	   partially	   overlap	   with	   functional	   and	   technical	   requirements.	   Figure	   26	   describes	   the	   three	   types	   of	   requirements	   that	   form	   the	   overall	   system	   requirements.	    	   Figure	   26.

The	   following	   section	   discusses	   the	   requirements	   presented	   by	   such	   initiatives	   on	   a	   production	   management	   and	   control	   system.	   5.1.3.1	   Factors	   to	   improve	   construction	   management	   on	   site	   In	   an	   earlier	   study	   on	   the	   simulation	   of	   information	   flow	   to	   help	   design	   decision-­making,	    Hassan	    (1996)	    identified	    the	    following	    factors	    to	    improve	    the	   management	    of	    construction	    site	    management	    processes	    and	    coordination	    of	   activities.	   • Schedule	    creation	    through	    4D	    models,	    which	    help	    visualise	    schedule	   constraints	    and	    opportunities	    for	    improvements	    through	    re-­‐scheduling	   and	   reallocation	   of	   workspace.	   • Schedule	    analysis:	    4D	    models	    help	    analyse	    schedules	    and	    visualise	   conflicts	   that	   are	   not	   apparent	   in	   Gantt	   charts	   and	   CPM	   programmes.	   • Communication:	    To	    help	    improve	    the	    stakeholders’	    understanding	    of	   project	   activities	   and	   the	   product	   (structure)	   to	   be	   built	   • Team	   building:	   To	   support	   and	   improve	   collaboration	   through	   a	   shared,	   visual	   model	   that	   is	   capable	   of	   communicating	   and	   sharing	   project	   issues.	   5.1.3.2	   Lean	   Enterprise	   Web-­‐based	   Information	   System	   for	   Construction	   –	   LEWIS	    	   Sriprasert	    and	    Dawood	    (2003)	    put	    forward	    the	    following	    requirements	    for	    a	   production	   management	   system:	   • Consideration	    of	    the	    level	    of	    planning	    and	    collaboration:	    Here	   it	   is	   meant	    that	    the	    production	    management	    should	    be	    able	    to	    support	    the	   planning	   and	   scheduling	   not	   only	   at	   the	   master	   level,	   but	   also	   at	   the	   look-­ahead	    planning	    and	    weekly	    level,	    i.e.	    fine	    grained	    planning	    should	    be	   supported.	   • Consideration	    of	    constraints:	    The	    flow	    aspect	    of	    the	    production	   management,	   i.e.	   management	   constraints	   that	   are	   defined	   previously	   in	   Section	    3	    should	    be	    supported	    by	    the	    system.	    These	    constraints	   (including	    physical,	    design,	    and	    contract	    related)	    must	    be	    effectively	   communicated,	   evaluated	   and	   removed	   before	   releasing	   the	   assignments	   (tasks)	   to	   workers.	   • Handling	    uncertainty:	    Uncertainty	    in	    production	    must	    be	    recognised	   and	    proactively	    absorbed	    by	    inserting	    appropriate	    buffers	    into	    project	   schedule.	   • Visual	    representation:	    Advanced	    visualisation	    techniques	    should	    be	   used	   to	   evaluate	   and	   inform	   planning	   output.	   The	   advanced	   visualisation	   can	   also	   be	   supported	   by	   simple	   tools	   such	   as	   worksheets	   and	   bar	   charts	   while	   issuing	   instructions	   to	   the	   work	   crew.	   5.1.3.3	   4D	   requirements	   for	   Planner’s	   Information	   Visualisation	   System	   Aranda-­‐Mena	    et	    al.

The	    authors	    identify	    the	    following	   key	   factors:	   • Reduce	   sources	   and	   effects	   of	   uncertainty	   • Create	   conceptual	   “what-­‐if”	   scenarios	   (reducing	   variability)	   • Provide	   friendly	   user	   interface	   and	   tools	   • Assist	   in	   decision-­‐making	   on	   time	   and	   resources	   5.1.3.4	   Lean	   Production	   Management	   System	   Requirement	    	   Sacks	   et	   al.

Lean	    Construction	    Requirements	    and	    CAVT	    Support	    (Sacks	    et	    al.,	   2009).	   Lean construction requirement Computer-aided visualisation tools Production System Design and Production Planning Plan for stable work – plan project activities effectively, predicting problems and safety issues 4D CAD modelling including space resources and temporary facilities (Akinci et al. 2002; McKinney and Fischer 1998) Communicate standardised processes to workers Modelling of production details using BIM and 4D CAD animation videos Production management and control Monitor production and record performance benchmarks for improvement experiments Visual tools for input of production data Make process transparent to all Electronic status boards can show current status of tasks. Progress can also be displayed by superimposing 4D colour coded images on site photographs (Fard and Pena-Mora 2007) Filter work packages for maturity to ensure stability The Last Planner System™ (Ballard 2000) can be supported by visual status charts that show the readiness of equipment, materials, space, information, etc. BIM can support dynamic safety conscious work filtering using the CHASTE model (Sacks et al. 2007) Pull technical information for work packages when needed On-line pull of up to date drawings and other information from a BIM server (Sacks and Derin 2006) Provide pull flow signals to regulate work flow Work in progress is not visible, like in manufacturing, so directives to action pull work. On-line pull flow is needed and must be communicated to teams (Sacks and Goldin 2007) Pull detailing and fabrication/assembly of building system components according to short term planning to match production flow Collaborative detailing with integration across disciplines (Khanzode et al. 2005)  Just-in-time delivery of material and parts BIM can provide accurate and automated preparation of bills of materials for JIT delivery (Chau et al. 2004) Color-coded interface for giving pull signals Pull management attention to where it is needed, to release bottlenecks or facilitate flow Visual production flow monitors and safety risk levels can be used to attract management attention to nodes of instability or danger, e.g. use of Andon lights (Pereira 1998) and the CHASTE model (Sacks et al. 2007) Respond flexibly to change Design or process changes can be disruptive. Visual planning interface can enable managers to adapt construction plans/material and resource orders/work assignments flexibly and responsibly 5.1.3.5	   BIM	   based	   Lean	   Production	   Management	   Requirement	   Following	   from	   the	   CAVT	   research,	   in	   a	   recent	   research	   which	   integrates	   Lean	   Construction	   processes	   with	   Building	   Information	   Modelling,	   Sacks	   et	   al.	   (2009)	   outline	   the	   requirements	   for	   a	   BIM	   based	   lean	   production	   management	   system	   for	   construction,	   which	   are	   discussed	   below.	   Process	   visualisation:	   It	   is	   suggested	   that	   the	   status	   and	   location	   of	   work	   teams	   and	    the	    real-­‐time	    maturity	    of	    pending	    tasks	    are	    displayed	    to	    support	    the	   negotiation	   and	   reporting	   of	   plan	   changes	   on	   a	   daily	   level.	   It	   is	   also	   suggested	   the	   system	   must	   enable	   communication	   and	   feedback	   of	   decisions.	   Such	   production	   status	   related	   information	   should	   be	   overlaid	   and	   integrated	   with	   a	   BIM	   platform	   where	   it	   would	   be	   possible	   to	   filter/query	   the	   objects	   for	   their	   relationships	   with	   work	   packages	   and	   relevant	   status.	   Product	   and	   method	   visualisation:	   Here	   the	   authors	   highlight	   the	   need	   to	   take	   the	    product	    and	    method	    visualisation	    to	    the	    “coal	    face”,	    i.e.	    to	    improve	    the	   availability	   of	   such	   information	   to	   construction	   workers	   in	   the	   field.	   The	   authors	   suggest	   a	   large	   touch	   screen	   device	   (such	   as	   a	   Plasma	   display	   with	   touch	   overlay)	   that	    enable	    individual	    or	    group/collaborative	    viewing	    of	    product	    and	    method	   visualisation.	   Computation	   and	   display	   of	   work	   package	   and	   task	   maturity:	   Task	   maturity	   is	   defined	   as	   a	   measure	   of	   the	   state	   of	   readiness	   of	   a	   work	   package	   or	   a	   task,	   and	   is	   an	   evaluation	   of	   the	   degree	   to	   which	   any	   constraints	   pre-­‐conditions	   have	   been	   released.	   Two	   main	   functions	   of	   the	   maturity	   index	   are	   put	   forward,	   to	   support	   short-­‐term	   decision	   making	   by	   team	   leaders	   before	   committing	   to	   a	   task	   and	   to	   support	    weekly	    planning	    activities.	    The	    maturity	    index	    is	    calculated	   automatically	    by	    the	    system	    as	    a	    composite	    of	    the	    maturity	    measures	    of	    each	   distinct	   pre-­‐conditions	   (i.e.	   constraints	   and	   is	   time	   dependent	   (i.e.	   is	   different	   at	   any	   given	   time).	   Support	    for	    planning,	    negotiation,	    commitment	    and	    status	    feedback:	    This	   requirement	   corresponds	   to	   the	   recognition	   that	   the	   conceptualisations	   used	   to	   at	   the	   planning	   level	   are	   not	   in	   sufficient	   level	   of	   resolution	   to	   be	   applied	   to	   the	   production	    level.	    As	    a	    construction	    project	    is	    a	    highly	    dynamic	    environment,	   production	   planning	   has	   to	   respond	   to	   the	   changing	   situation	   on	   almost	   a	   daily	   basis,	    where	    relationships	    between	    trade	    teams	    (negotiations	    about	    work	   sequence,	    space	    utilisation,	    etc.)	    has	    to	    be	    managed	    effectively,	    in	    order	    to	   prepare	   conflict-­‐free	   and	   coordinated	   work	   plans.	   The	   production	   management	   system	   should	   support	   that,	   hence	   agility	   is	   needed.	   Following	   requirements	   are	   put	   forward	   by	   the	   authors	   in	   support	   of	   this:	   • Tightly	    integrate	    planning	    and	    production	    control.	    The	    granularity	    of	    the	   weekly	    work	    planning	    and	    the	    level	    of	    detail	    of	    task	    properties	    must	    be	   appropriate	   for	   daily	   production	   control	   • Enable	   online	   feedback	   from	   the	   workface	   to	   ensure	   that	   the	   process	   status	   information	   is	   up-­‐to-­‐date	   • Provide	    a	    channel	    of	    communication	    for	    negotiation	    of	    changes	    to	    planned	   tasks,	    reducing	    the	    planning	    window	    to	    daily	    level,	    extending	    the	    Last	   Planner	   System™.	   This	   requires	   enabling	   the	   trade	   team	   leaders	   to	   propose	   plan	   changes,	   identify	   and	   resolve	   any	   resulting	   conflicts	   through	   negotiation	   with	   the	   affected	   parties,	   and	   inform	   all	   other	   project	   participants	   of	   resulting	   changes	   • To	    improve	    the	    reliability	    of	    planning	    and	    coordination	    on	    construction	   projects,	    use	    of	    language/action	    perspective	    is	    recommended.	   Language/action	   perspective	   refers	   to	   the	   idea	   that	   creativity	   in	   projects	   is	   coordinated	    through	    making	    and	    keeping	    commitments	    rather	    than	    by	   directives	    from	    managers.	    Language/action	    perspective	    recommends	    a	   system	    or	    a	    process	    of	    request,	    commitment,	    action	    and	    reporting	   completion.	   It	   is	   suggested	   that	   the	   production	   management	   system	   should	   incorporate/support	    the	    language/action	    perspective	    by	    facilitating	    the	   reporting	   of	   start	   and	   completion	   or	   stoppage	   of	   tasks.	   • It	   is	   proposed	   that	   the	   production	   management	   should	   recognise	   the	   fact	   that	   the	   work	   planning	   and	   coordination	   is	   a	   human/people	   centric	   activity	   and	   the	    software	    is	    supporting	    the	    collaboration	    and	    coordination	    rather	    than	   replacing	   it.	   The	   system	   should	   also	   recognise	   the	   chain	   of	   authority	   and	   that	   the	    final	    authority	    in	    resolving	    any	    conflict	    should	    lie	    with	    the	    project	   construction	   manager.	   Implement	    pull	    flow	    control:	    It	    is	    proposed	    that	    an	    online	    (visual)	    process	   status	   displays	   should	   be	   used	   as	   a	   means	   to	   communicate	   pull	   signals	   to	   work	   teams	    to	    facilitate	    “pulling”	    of	    work.	    The	    key	    principle	    (similar	    to	    the	    KanBan	   system)	    is	    to	    reduce	    the	    work	    in	    progress	    (and	    in	    turn	    inventory),	    which	    is	   considered	   to	   be	   one	   of	   the	   most	   abundant	   wastes	   in	   production	   systems.	   This	   strategy	    can	    be	    applied	    individually	    to	    one	    trade	    contractor	    or	    collectively	    to	   multiple	    trade	    contractors	    if	    there	    are	    connected	    or	    concurrent	    tasks,	    where	   teams	    are	    competing	    for	    space	    or	    other	    resources.	    A	    probability	    index	    called	   “pull	    flow	    index”	    which	    is	    defined	    as	    a	    “measure	    of	    the	    likelihood	    that	    the	   sequence	   of	   tasks	   following	   the	   current	   task,	   that	   is	   needed	   to	   complete	   a	   zone	   or	   product,	   can	   be	   performed	   continuously	   to	   completion.”	   is	   proposed	   to	   be	   used	   by	   construction	   managers	   while	   setting	   task	   priorities.	   It	   is	   also	   advised	   by	   the	   authors	   that	   contingency	   tasks,	   which	   are	   completely	   free	   of	   constraints	   and	   not	   connected	    to	    contemporaneous	    tasks,	    should	    be	    used	    to	    add	    short-­‐term	   flexibility	   and	   to	   act	   as	   a	   buffer.	   Maintain	    work	    flow	    and	    plan	    stability:	    It	    is	    stated	    as	    a	    requirement	    that	    to	   ensure	    stable	    work	    and	    to	    minimise	    the	    occurrence	    of	    “making	    do”,	    any	    tasks	   which	   are	   executed	   must	   be	   recorded	   in	   the	   system	   and	   that	   no	   “ad	   hoc”	   changes	   should	    be	    allowed	    during	    the	    week	    once	    the	    plan	    has	    been	    agreed	    by	    all	   stakeholders.	   Also,	   any	   failure	   due	   to	   unavailability	   of	   a	   part	   or	   an	   error	   in	   its	   fabrication	   or	   design	   information	   should	   be	   made	   transparent	   and	   not	   hidden	   by	   removing	   that	   task	   from	   the	   plan.	   Formalise	   experimentation	   for	   continuous	   improvement:	   It	   is	   suggested	   that	   the	   system	   should	   allow	   for	   structured	   experimentation	   by	   selecting	   one	   or	   more	   specific	    tasks	    each	    week	    and	    flagging	    them	    up	    (visually)	    as	    experiment	    tasks,	   along	   with	   a	   definition	   of	   what	   the	   goal	   of	   the	   experiment	   is	   and	   how	   it	   will	   be	   measured.	    It	    is	    suggested	    that	    such	    formalised	    experimentation	    would	    lead	    to	   continuous	   improvement	   on	   current	   and	   future	   projects.	   Sacks	   et	   al.	   (2009)	   have	   also	   described	   different	   aspects	   of	   construction	   planning	   and	   control	   operational	   at	   various	   levels	   on	   the	   project	   as	   shown	   in	   Table	   17.	   It	   is	   important	    to	    understand	    this	    while	    designing	    a	    new	    system	    as	    planning	   processes	   at	   all	   levels	   must	   be	   catered	   for.	   Table	   17.

Secondly,	    requirements	    that	    are	    extracted	    from	   previous	   research	   initiatives	   in	   developing	   production	   management	   and	   control	   system,	   where	   integration	   of	   product	   and	   process	   modelling	   has	   been	   considered	   as	   discussed	   above.	   The	   following	   six	   factors	   are	   extracted	   from	   Koskela	   (1999)	   and	   Ballard	   (2000)	   to	   form	   the	   basic	   requirements	   of	   a	   production	   management	   system:	   • Supporting	   flow	   (workflow)	   • Reducing	   variability	   through	   sound	   assignments	   • Supporting	   pull	   techniques	   • Measure	   and	   monitoring	   to	   support	   continuous	   process	   improvement	   • Maintaining	   a	   buffer	   of	   unassigned	   tasks	   • Supporting	   distributed	   decision	   making	   through	   collaboration	   Sacks	    et	    al.	    (2009,	    2010b)	    have	    provided	    comprehensive	    requirements	    for	    a	   computerised	    production	    management	    system	    that	    integrates	    process	    and	   product	   visualisation.	   Sriprasert	   and	   Dawood	   (2003)	   have	   also	   highlighted	   key	   requirements	    for	    a	    visual	    production	    management	    system	    that	    takes	    into	   consideration	    the	    Last	    Planner™	    approach.	    Overall,	    the	    above-­‐mentioned	   requirements	    from	    previous	    research	    cover	    most	    aspects	    of	    production	   management	    including	    the	    integration	    of	    product	    and	    process	    modelling.	   Although	    there	    are	    subtle	    differences	    in	    the	    context	    and	    detail	    at	    which	    each	   research	   has	   addressed	   these	   requirements,	   and	   also	   there	   are	   differences	   due	   to	   the	    chronological	    gap	    between	    the	    research	    period	    (and	    technology	    changing	   rapidly	    in	    during	    this	    period),	    there	    are	    significant	    overlaps	    between	    them.	   These	   requirements	   are	   taken	   on	   board	   at	   a	   high	   level	   of	   abstraction,	   however	   there	   are	   additions	   made,	   where	   the	   detailed	   requirements	   are	   outlined	   later	   in	   5.3.	   The	   main	   difference	   between	   VisiLean	   and	   the	   above	   mentioned	   research	   is	   that	   VisiLean	   is	   designed	   to	   be	   used	   directly	   by	   the	   production	   crew	   on	   site	   and	   is	   meant	   to	   be	   a	   simple	   yet	   effective	   solution	   that	   integrates	   process	   and	   product	   representation	   in	   a	   visual	   way.	   Some	   of	   the	   major	   differences	   are	   outlined	   in	   the	   discussion	   following	   Table	   18.	   5.1.5	   A	   Critical	   Review	   of	   Previous	   Research	    	   Previous	   efforts	   in	   improving	   production	   planning	   and	   control	   were	   reviewed	   in	   Section	    5.1.3.	    While	    they	    provide	    valuable	    information	    that	    can	    be	    considered	   while	   designing	   a	   production	   management	   system,	   they	   are	   not	   complete	   and	   do	   not	   address	   some	   critical	   aspects	   that	   emerged	   during	   the	   problem	   identification	   and	   literature	   review.	   While	   Hassan	   (1996)	   provides	   a	   high	   level	   framework	   to	   improve	    construction	    management	    through	    use	    of	    4D	    visualisation	    and	   simulation	    of	    information	    flow,	    there	    is	    no	    detailed	    framework	    provided	    to	   tackle	   aspects	   such	   as	   the	   specific	   information	   flows,	   constraints	   analysis	   or	   the	   production	    planning	    workflow	    such	    as	    the	    Last	    Planner™	    system.	    Some	   commercial	    systems	    such	    as	    Autodesk	    Navisworks,	    Tekla	    Structures	   (Construction	    Management),	    Vico	    Control	    etc.	    are	    understood	    to	    be	    providing	   such	   features	   now,	   however,	   they	   only	   partially	   address	   the	   problem	   as	   has	   been	   discussed	    previously.	    Sriprasert	    and	    Dawood	    (2003)	    provide	    a	    framework	    in	   LEWIS	    for	    a	    production-­‐scheduling	    platform	    using	    constraints	    analysis	    and	   visual	   representation.	   Although	   there	   is	   a	   consideration	   of	   constraints	   analysis	   and	   visual	   representation	   of	   the	   process,	   the	   system	   is	   predominantly	   designed	   for	    head-­‐office	    based	    planning	    and	    scheduling	    activities,	    which	    will	    push	    the	   plans	    to	    the	    site,	    as	    there	    are	    no	    specific	    interfaces	    designed	    for	    site	    based	   collaborative	    planning	    or	    control	    activities.	    Aranda-­‐Mena	    et	    al.	    (2004)	    have	   provided	   a	   high	   level	   framework	   for	   4D	   development	   of	   a	   planner’s	   information	   system.	   Although	   the	   requirements	   are	   relevant,	   they	   are	   not	   detailed	   and	   do	   not	   specifically	   address	   site	   based	   production	   planning	   or	   scheduling.	   Also,	   there	   is	   no	    mention	    of	    simultaneous	    visualisation,	    integration	    and	    synchronisation	    of	   process	    and	    product	    views	    or	    constraints	    analysis	    and	    production	    control	   activities.	    Sacks	    et	    al.	    (2009)	    provide	    a	    summary	    of	    requirements	    for	    a	   production	   management	   system.	   Although	   the	   requirements	   are	   comprehensive,	   they	    do	    not	    constitute	    a	    single	    integrated	    system	    meant	    to	    address	    site	    based	   processes,	   but	   distributed	   systems	   that	   partially	   address	   the	   requirements.	   Sacks	   et	   al.	   (2010)	   subsequently	   have	   proposed	   a	   set	   of	   requirements	   in	   design	   of	   their	   KanBIM	   system,	   which	   are	   discussed	   separately	   in	   section	   5.1.6.	   To	   summarise,	   none	    of	    the	    previous	    requirement	    compilations	    comprehensively	    provides	    a	   framework	    for	    a	    system	    that	    addresses	    all	    three	    aspects	    in	    a	    production	   management	    system	    that	    emerged	    as	    critical	    requirements	    in	    Chapter	    3,	    i.e.	   those	   of	   simultaneous	   visualisation,	   integration	   and	   synchronisation	   of	   product	   and	   process.	   Also,	   not	   all	   the	   requirements	   are	   directly	   addressing	   a	   production	   management	    and	    control	    system	    designed	    for	    site-­‐based	    activities	    and	   supporting	    a	    lean	    workflow.	    However,	    some	    of	    these	    requirements	    are	    still	   relevant	   to	   the	   design	   of	   a	   production	   management	   system	   and	   are	   taken	   into	   account	   while	   designing	   VisiLean.	   5.1.6	   Defining	   VisiLean	   Requirements	   Framework	   Following	   key	   aspects	   emerge	   from	   the	   study	   of	   literature,	   which	   are	   shown	   in	   Table	    18.	    These	    aspects	    along	    with	    feedback	    capture	    from	    practitioners	    are	   taken	   into	   consideration	   while	   designing	   VisiLean.	   Table	   18.	   Defining	   VisiLean	   requirements.	   Requirement Discussion Process 	and product visualisation at the “coal face” This is one of the most significant and overlapping requirement that emerges from past research (and also from prior case studies and exploration of the problem area). This means that the information regarding the planning and scheduling, along with the relevant design information (that forms the product model) should be made available to workers (construction team) on site. Supporting constraints analysis and management This is also an essential requirement for a production management system and an aspect that is often neglected in most current systems. The system should allow the teams to identify, analyse and assign constraints. Once assigned the system should also allow tracking the status of the constraints linked to the tasks. Finally, analysis in the efficiency of removal of constraints should also be facilitated.  Supporting collaboration, work negotiation and communication between the project team Addressing people issues, building trust, improving coordination and communication and securing commitment to the production plan are some of the most critical issues that a new system has to address. All previous research initiatives recognise this aspect and put forward collaboration as a key requirement for a production planning system. Collaboration spans the entire lifecycle of the project, starting from lean work structuring and continuing to look-ahead planning, weekly commitment planning and daily execution, feedback and coordination (including start-stop signals). The other key aspect to be recognised is that the production management process is a highly people centric and the goal of the computerised system should be to support the collaboration rather than automate the process. Many previous attempts have failed where the users have been alienated from the system due to high level of automation or the complicated nature of the system. Enable “pull” flow control and plan stability From lean perspective, “pull” production management is a key to reduce variability, which is one of the biggest enemies causing waste and uncertainty on construction. All previous researchers have identified the need for the system to support a combination of “push” and “pull” techniques to maintain plan stability and reduce variability. As can be observed in Table 13, the system should support the workflow starting from Master Planning and Phase Planning going on to Look-ahead plan and then weekly planning and daily execution. During this process the key aspect is that the system enables the users to create a workable backlog of constraint free tasks, which can be selected based on their priorities to improve flow and reduce work in progress, while also supporting coordination by signalling to downstream crew when the preceding task is completed.   Koskela	   (2000)	   presents	   the	   TFV	   (Transformation,	   Flow	   and	   Value)	   framework	   to	    tackle	    production	    in	    construction.	    He	    claims	    that	    all	    these	    three	   conceptualizations	   of	   production	   are	   necessary	   and	   that	   they	   should	   be	   utilized	   simultaneously.	    This	    is	    one	    of	    the	    most	    fundamental,	    theoretical	    frameworks	   from	    lean	    perspective	    that	    the	    VisiLean	    system	    should	    address.	    Table	    19	   describes	    the	    specific	    features	    within	    VisiLean	    that	    address	    the	    TFV	   requirements.	   Table	   19.	   Addressing	   TFV	   through	   VisiLean.	   VisiLean Features Transformation Flow Value Planning 	and Scheduling Task Planning, and Scheduling- in Phase, Lookahead and Weekly Planning (software) interfaces help to maintain consistency in task specification. Managing the flow of resources through constraints analysis and management. Assigning constraints to tasks and also the responsibility to manage them to workers and teams. Reduction in making-do through improved performance of constraints removal process, leading to better performing planning and scheduling system leading to sounder tasks, less rework and better quality. Task Management Assigning 	task completion responsibility at the Last Planner level to workers.  To make input flows visible through linking of constraints to tasks (and their current status). Simultaneous Visualisation of process and product Visualisation of task information in process and model views, i.e. where and when the task is supposed to be executed. Managing the flow of work between long term, medium term and short term planning processes. Reduction of confusion through joint appraisal of production plan in both process and product views, improving the quality of work and reducing risk of rework and delays due to misunderstandings. Production Control Production control features of starting, stopping and completing tasks and their visualisation in both the model and process views. Managing and visualising in process flow between production tasks by Visualisation of task statuses in both product and process views. Visibility of upstream task completion to downstream stakeholders. One	   of	   the	   requirements	   put	   forward	   by	   Sacks	   et	   al.	   (2009)	   is	   that	   of	   maturity	   and	   pull	   flow	   index.	   Although	   providing	   construction	   teams	   an	   indication	   of	   the	   task	    maturity	    based	    on	    the	    status	    of	    the	    constraint	    seems	    beneficial,	    the	   associated	   risk	   regarding	   the	   accuracy	   is	   too	   great	   for	   it	   to	   be	   considered	   viable.	   As	    a	    construction	    project	    is	    a	    highly	    dynamic	    requirement	    and	    availability	    of	   resources	   change	   constantly	   the	   construction	   managers	   and	   trades	   foreman	   are	   the	   best	   judge	   when	   it	   comes	   to	   making	   decisions	   regarding	   resource	   availability,	   and	   the	   final	   decision	   is	   best	   left	   for	   a	   human	   to	   make	   rather	   than	   a	   computer.	   The	   same	   applies	   for	   the	   “pull	   flow”	   index	   as	   it	   depends	   on	   the	   maturity	   index	   along	   with	   the	   status	   of	   connected	   tasks.	   As	   a	   result,	   these	   two	   features	   were	   not	   implemented	   in	   VisiLean.	   Also,	   majority	   of	   the	   systems	   discussed	   above	   did	   not	   put	   forward	   a	   requirement	   for	   information	   sources	   to	   be	   aggregated	   in	   the	   production	   system	   so	   that	   the	   information	   availability	   at	   the	   decision	   making	   point	   is	   improved.	   For	   example	   information	    about	    various	    resources	    could	    reside	    in	    information	    systems	   belonging	   to	   main	   contractor,	   subcontractor	   or	   other	   stakeholders.	   Traditional	   methods	   for	   integration	   of	   these	   information	   sources	   have	   been	   through	   direct	   links	   established	   between	   these	   systems,	   and	   as	   a	   result	   are	   seldom	   established.	   This	   leaves	   the	   production	   management	   system	   isolated	   from	   other	   information	   sources.	    Therefore,	    this	    is	    considered	    to	    an	    important	    requirement	    and	    is	   addressed	    using	    a	    distributed	    web-­‐services	    framework	    that	    will	    discussed	   further	   below.	    	   5.1.7	   Differences	   between	   KanBIM	   and	   VisiLean	   The	    main	    differentiating	    factor	    between	    VisiLean	    and	    KanBIM	    (Sacks	    et	    al.,	   2010)	   is	   that	   the	   predominant	   focus	   in	   VisiLean	   is	   on	   production	   planning	   and	   scheduling	   with	   a	   partial	   coverage	   of	   the	   control	   aspect,	   whereas	   in	   KanBIM	   the	   main	   focus	   is	   on	   the	   control	   workflow.	   Specifically,	   the	   following	   features	   are	   the	   ones,	   which	   are	   unique	   to	   VisiLean:	   The	    Last	    Planner	    Workflow.	    This	    feature	    resulted	    from	    one	    of	    the	    most	   strategic	    decisions	    and	    provides	    a	    key	    differentiator	    between	    the	    KanBIM	    and	   VisiLean	    system.	    Where	    the	    KanBIM	    system	    took	    the	    planning	    workflow	    as	    a	   given	   and	   started	   from	   control	   perspective	   (in	   defining	   task	   maturity,	   readiness	   index	    and	    production	    status	    control),	    the	    VisiLean	    system	    focussed	    on	    the	   production	   planning	   and	   control	   workflow	   with	   the	   Last	   Planner™	   system.	   As	   a	   result,	    the	    following	    three	    planning	    components	    form	    the	    core	    part	    of	    the	   VisiLean	   system:	   i. Phase	   Planning	   ii. Look-­‐Ahead	   planning	   iii. Weekly	   Planning	   and	   execution	   Constraints	    Analysis	    and	    Management.	    Also,	    the	    constraints	    analysis	    and	   management	   feature,	   where	   each	   task	   is	   analysed	   and	   constraints	   added	   during	   the	    Look-­‐ahead	    meeting,	    is	    unique	    to	    VisiLean.	    The	    constraints	    are	    then	   managed	    (they	    have	    to	    be	    removed	    before	    the	    execution	    week	    in	    order	    to	   “release”	   a	   task	   to	   the	   weekly	   schedule);	   this	   is	   a	   feature	   unique	   to	   VisiLean.	   Resource	   Clash	   Detection.	   A	   unique	   resource	   clash	   detection	   function	   has	   been	   built	   in	   VisiLean,	   which	   identifies	   clashes	   between	   resources	   (i.e.	   if	   a	   resource	   has	   been	   assigned	   to	   multiple	   tasks	   at	   the	   same	   time).	   This	   is	   not	   present	   in	   the	   KanBIM	   system.	   Project	    Administration,	    task	    definition	    and	    organisational	    structures.	    In	   VisiLean,	   it	   is	   possible	   to	   define	   organisational	   units	   at	   three	   different	   levels:	    i. 	Organisations	   (subcontractors,	   suppliers	   etc.)	   ii. 	Individuals	   (which	   belong	   to	   an	   organisation,	   or	   are	   independent)	   iii. 	Teams	    made	    up	    of	    individuals	    belonging	    to	    the	    same	    or	    different	   organisations.	   Also,	   there	   were	   some	   features	   in	   KanBIM	   that	   were	   not	   implement	   in	   VisiLean	   from	   a	   strategic	   perspective.	   For	   example,	   KanBIM	   implements	   a	   feature	   called	   maturity	   index,	   which	   has	   been	   described	   above.	    	   However,	    when	    designing	    Visilean,	    it	    was	    decided	    that	    a	    simple	    checklist	    and	   “yes”	    or	    “no”	    decision	    by	    humans	    (project	    team)	    would	    be	    better,	    as	    the	   probability	   index	   could	   mislead	   and	   create	   a	   false	   sense	   of	   security	   where	   the	   remaining,	   say	   5%	   (unavailability	   of	   a	   resource)	   could	   result	   in	   a	   task	   completion	   becoming	   impossible	   (on	   schedule),	   and	   could	   result	   in	   “making	   do”.	   In	    summary,	    it	    was	    informally	    agreed	    between	    KanBIM	    and	    VisiLean	    research	   teams	   that	   while	   VisiLean	   will	   focus	   on	   the	   planning	   and	   scheduling	   workflow,	   the	    KanBIM	    team	    will	    address	    the	    control	    workflow	    and	    visualisation	    of	   production	    status.	    During	    development,	    exchanges	    of	    information	    between	   research	    teams	    took	    place	    in	    terms	    of	    3	    virtual	    and	    2	    physical	    meetings	   (workshops).	   Overall,	   it	   can	   be	   stated	   that	   although	   both	   systems	   were	   designed	   separately,	   there	   was	   collaboration	   at	   a	   conceptual	   level,	   and	   consequently	   they	   complement	   each	   other	   well.	   5.2	   Choosing	   the	   Design	   Methodology	   Based	   on	   the	   feedback	   gathered	   through	   focus	   group	   interviews	   and	   workshops	   and	    also	    through	    the	    literature	    as	    discussed	    above,	    a	    set	    of	    requirements	    was	   developed.	   As	   with	   any	   software	   development	   project,	   it	   is	   difficult	   to	   set	   very	   accurate	    or	    detailed	    requirements	    from	    the	    start.	    As	    understanding	    about	    the	   problem	   area	   evolves	   and	   a	   solution	   starts	   to	   take	   shape,	   further	   requirements	   are	   considered	   and	   initial	   requirements	   are	   evaluated.	    	   The	    actual	    software	    development	    was	    carried	    out	    by	    another	    researcher	   (colleague	   of	   the	   author)	   working	   on	   the	   same	   project.	   The	   scope	   of	   the	   research	   reported	    in	    this	    thesis	    from	    software	    development	    perspective	    was	    the	   following:	   • Define	   the	   conceptual	   requirements	   • Specify	   the	   functional	   requirement	   • Take	   part	   in	   the	   technology	   selection,	   i.e.	   software	   development	   platform,	   selection	   of	   the	   3D	   viewing	   platform	   and	   the	   communication	   methods	   • Continuous	   feedback	   in	   development	   and	   testing	   of	   the	   prototype	   • Demonstration	    to	    the	    industry	    and	    research	    community,	    gathering	   feedback	    from	    partnering	    organisations,	    providing	    feedback	    to	    the	   developer	   This	   section	   outlines	   the	   design	   process,	   how	   it	   was	   carried	   out	   and	   translated	   in	   software	   requirements,	   and	   the	   overall	   software	   architecture.	   Screenshots	   of	   the	   software	    prototype	    are	    provided	    to	    demonstrate	    how	    the	    functionalities	    were	   realised,	   with	   high	   resolution	   screenshots	   in	   Appendix	   C.	   However,	   details	   of	   the	   actual	   programming	   process	   are	   not	   included	   in	   this	   discussion.	   5.2.1	   Development	   methodology	   Traditional	    software	    development	    methods	    such	    as	    Waterfall	    Method	    of	   software	   development	   are	   criticised	   for	   their	   inefficiencies.	   This	   is	   mainly	   as	   the	   inherent	    shortcomings	    lead	    to	    unsatisfactory,	    unreliable	    and	    nonperforming	   products	    (Highsmith	    and	    Cockburn,	    2001;	    Paetsch	    et	    al.,	    2003;	    Davis	    et	    al.,	   1988).	   Highsmith	   and	   Cockburn	   (2001)	   report	   on	   a	   recent	   study	   of	   more	   than	   200	   software	   development	   projects	   carried	   out,	   where	   the	   researchers	   couldn’t	   find	   the	   original	   plans	   to	   measure	   the	   final	   product	   against.	   This	   is	   as	   the	   original	   plan	    was	    considered	    significantly	    out-­‐of-­‐date	    and	    the	    requirements	    changed	   significantly	    during	    the	    process	    to	    meet	    customer	    demand.	    One	    of	    the	    main	   reasons	   behind	   this	   is	   that	   the	   traditional	   methods	   put	   a	   significant	   emphasis	   on	   defining	   the	   complete	   set	   of	   requirements	   early	   and	   would	   not	   factor	   the	   change	   or	   variability	   in	   the	   process.	   The	   traditional	   methods	   can	   be	   seen	   as	   plan-­‐based	   methods	    (similar	    to	    the	    “T”	    view	    in	    production),	    which	    emphasise	    “a	   rationalised,	    engineering-­‐based	    approach”	    in	    which	    it	    is	    claimed	    that	    the	   problems	    are	    fully	    specifiable	    and	    that	    optimal	    and	    predictable	    solutions	    exist	   for	    each	    problem.	    The	    traditional	    methods	    emphasize	    on	    extensive	    planning,	   codified	    processes,	    and	    rigorous	    reuse	    to	    make	    the	    software	    develop	    in	    an	   efficient	   and	   predictable	   manner	   (Dybå	   and	   Dingsøyr,	   2008).	    	   One	   of	   these	   traditional	   method	   is	   Requirement	   Engineering	   which	   is	   concerned	   with	    identifying,	    modelling,	    communicating	    and	    documenting	    the	    requirement	   for	   a	   system,	   and	   the	   contexts	   in	   which	   the	   system	   will	   be	   used.	   (Paetsch	   et	   al.,	   2003).	    The	    aim	    of	    Requirements	    Engineering	    is	    to	    help	    define	    what	    to	    build	   before	   system	   development	   starts	   in	   order	   to	   prevent	   rework,	   and	   is	   based	   on	   two	   major	   assumptions:	   • The	   later	   mistakes	   are	   discovered,	   the	   more	   expensive	   it	   will	   be	   correct	   them	   (Beck,	   1999)	   • It	    is	    possible	    to	    determine	    a	    stable	    set	    of	    requirements	    before	    system	   design	   and	   implementation	   starts	   The	   Requirements	   Engineering	   process	   consists	   of	   five	   main	   activities	   (Kotonya	   and	   Sommerville,	   1997,	   Paetsch	   et	   al.,	   2003):	   • Elicitation	   • Analysis	   and	   negotiation	   • Documentation	   • Validation	   and	   • Management	   The	   traditional	   approaches	   can	   be	   likened	   to	   the	   “Transformation”	   or	   “T”	   view	   as	   discussed	    in	    Chapter	    3	    as	    in	    the	    manufacturing	    and	    construction	    sector.	    As	    in	   both	    cases,	    there	    is	    significant	    emphasis	    on	    advance	    detail	    planning,	    work	   breakdown	    and	    allocation	    and	    individual	    optimisation	    of	    tasks	    and	    work	   streams.	   In	   the	   latest	   developments	   in	   software	   development	   methods,	   it	   is	   identified	   that	   the	   challenge	   is	   not	   in	   just	   accommodating	   change,	   but	   accounting	   for	   it	   and	   at	   the	    same	    time	    maintaining	    quality	    output.	    A	    relatively	    new	    software	   development	   paradigm,	   the	   Agile	   Software	   Development	   methods	   are	   a	   response	   to	    this	    challenge,	    where	    the	    strategy	    is	    to	    reduce	    the	    impact	    of	    change	   throughout	    the	    project	    (Highsmith	    and	    Cockburn,	    2001).	    Paetsch	    et	    al.	    (2003)	   describe	   key	   differentiators	   of	   the	   Agile	   development	   methods:	   • Agile	   methods	   are	   adaptive	   rather	   than	   predictive.	   With	   traditional	   methods,	   most	   of	   the	   software	   process	   is	   planned	   in	   detail	   over	   a	   large	   time	   frame.	   This	   works	    well	    if	    not	    much	    is	    changing	    (i.e.	    low	    requirements	    churn)	    and	    the	   application	    domain	    and	    software	    technologies	    are	    well	    understood	    by	    the	   development	    team.	    Agile	    methods	    are	    developed	    to	    adapt	    and	    thrive	    on	   frequent	   changes.	   • Agile	   methods	   are	   people-­‐oriented	   rather	   than	   process	   oriented.	   They	   rely	   on	   people’s	    expertise,	    competency	    and	    direct	    collaboration	    rather	    than	    on	   rigorous,	   document	   centric	   processes	   to	   produce	   high-­‐quality	   software.	   Dybå	    and	    Dingsøyr	    (2008)	    also	    describe	    the	    main	    differences	    between	   traditional	    approaches	    mentioned	    above	    and	    agile	    software	    development	   processes	   as	   shown	   in	   Table	   20.	   Table	   20.

A	   summary	   of	   the	   most	   common	   methods	   has	   been	   provided	   in	   Appendix	   B.	    	   As	   this	   is	   a	   research	   project	   where	   the	   requirements	   are	   bound	   to	   be	   changing	   based	    upon	    emerging	    evidence	    and	    user	    feedback,	    the	    flexibility	    and	    agility	    of	   the	    development	    system	    are	    crucial.	    With	    Scrum,	    it	    is	    possible	    to	    declare	    a	   product	    “done”	    whenever	    required,	    and	    also	    as	    the	    prototype	    can	    be	   demonstrated	   and	   implemented	   at	   any	   stage	   in	   a	   participating	   organisation	   to	   capture	   feedback.	   As	   a	   result,	   Scrum	   was	   selected	   as	   the	   development	   method	   during	   this	   research.	   5.2.2	   The	   Development	   Process	   This	    research	    was	    carried	    out	    as	    a	    part	    of	    a	    larger	    research	    theme	    called	   “Seamless	    Delivery”	    within	    the	    Salford	    Centre	    for	    Research	    and	    Innovation	   (SCRI),	    under	    the	    work	    package	    “Collaborative	    Design,	    Planning	    and	   Construction”.	    There	    was	    a	    team	    of	    two	    researchers	    who	    developed	    VisiLean,	   where	   the	   scope	   of	   this	   research	   was	   to	   develop	   the	   concept,	   provide	   functional	   requirements,	    help	    with	    technology	    selection	    and	    assist	    in	    testing,	   demonstration	    and	    feedback	    gathering	    processes.	    The	    second	    member	    of	    the	   team	    carried	    out	    the	    programming	    activities,	    including	    designing	    database	   schema,	   object	   schema,	   prototype	   design	   and	   development.	   As	   a	   result,	   the	   actual	   programming	   activities	   are	   not	   presented	   in	   this	   thesis,	   as	   they	   were	   not	   within	   the	   scope	   of	   this	   research.	   The	   following	   development	   activities	   will	   be	   discussed	   as	   part	   of	   this	   research:	   • Defining	   Functional	   Requirements	   • Specifying	   the	   System	   • Developing	   the	   System	   Architecture	   • Iterative	   design	   of	   the	   System	   Subsequently,	   Chapter	   6	   describes	   the	   evaluation	   process	   including	   the	   following	   aspects.	   • Research	   Prototype	   Demonstrations	   • Pilot	   project	   implementation	   • Evaluating	   the	   system	   from	   the	   feedback	   As	   mentioned	   above	   Scrum	   was	   selected	   as	   the	   development	   method.	   In	   Scrum,	   the	    practice	    is	    focussed	    around	    an	    iterative	    and	    incremental	    process	    skeleton,	   which	   is	   shown	   in	   Figure	   27	   (Schwaber,	   2009).	   Here	   the	   lower	   circle	   represents	   the	   iteration	   of	   development	   activities,	   which	   occur	   one	   after	   another.	   Where	   the	   upper	    circle	    represents	    the	    daily	    inspection	    that	    occurs	    during	    that	    iteration,	   when	   the	   team	   members	   meet	   to	   inspect	   the	   progress	   and	   adapt	   to	   the	   changes.	   The	   main	   drivers	   behind	   the	   iteration	   are	   the	   functional	   requirements,	   and	   the	   cycle	   is	   repeated	   till	   the	   end	   of	   the	   project	   (or	   when	   the	   funding	   ceases).	   	   Figure	   27.	   Scrum	   Skeleton	   (Schwaber,	   2009).	   5.2.2.1	   Development	   Roles	   and	   Responsibilities	   According	   to	   Schwaber	   (2009)	   there	   are	   three	   roles	   in	   Scrum:	   • Product	   owner	   • The	   Team	   and	    	   • The	   Scrum	   Master	   The	   product	   owner	   is	   responsible	   for	   securing	   initial	   and	   on-­‐going	   funding	   for	   the	   project	   by	   developing	   the	   overarching	   concept,	   initial	   overall	   requirements,	   Return	    on	    Investment	    (ROI)	    objectives	    and	    release	    plans.	    The	    initial	   requirements	   is	   called	   the	   Product	   Backlog	   in	   Scrum,	   which	   helps	   prioritise	   the	   most	   valuable	   functionalities,	   and	   the	   requirements	   are	   prioritised	   frequently	   to	   correspond	   to	   the	   current	   situation.	   In	   developing	   VisiLean,	   as	   it	   was	   a	   research	   project,	   the	   task	   was	   to	   secure	   research	   funding	   and	   other	   resources	   (including	   personnel)	    to	    ensure	    the	    project	    can	    progress	    smoothly.	    The	    author	    was	    the	   Product	    Owner,	    who	    developed	    the	    initial	    requirements,	    and	    the	    product	   concept	    and	    secured	    the	    funding.	    As	    a	    Product	    Owner,	    the	    research	    candidate	   also	   engaged	   with	   the	   external	   and	   internal	   stakeholders	   to	   organise	   workshops,	   focus	    group	    interviews	    and	    meetings	    to	    gather	    feedback	    and	    capture	   requirements	   whenever	   necessary.	    	    	   The	   team	   is	   responsible	   for	   developing	   the	   functionality,	   and	   also	   responsible	   for	   ascertaining	    the	    process	    to	    turn	    the	    Product	    Backlog	    into	    an	    increment	    of	   functionality	   within	   an	   iteration	   and	   managing	   their	   own	   work	   to	   do	   so.	   In	   Scrum	   the	    Teams	    are	    self-­‐managing	    and	    organising	    and	    are	    also	    cross	    functional.	    As	   mentioned	    above,	    the	    research	    team	    consisted	    of	    the	    author	    and	    another	   researcher,	   who	   carried	   out	   the	   programming	   duties.	   The	   team	   met	   al.most	   daily	   to	   discuss	   the	   product	   backlog,	   and	   revise	   the	   priorities	   as	   necessary.	    	   The	   Scrum	   Master	   is	   responsible	   for	   managing	   the	   Scrum	   process,	   and	   to	   ensure	   that	    it	    delivers	    the	    results	    expected	    from	    the	    project.	    As	    it	    was	    a	    very	    small	   project	    team,	    the	    role	    of	    Scrum	    master	    was	    not	    very	    relevant	    as	    both	    the	   members	    understood	    the	    process	    well	    and	    knew	    what	    had	    to	    be	    delivered.	   However,	    as	    the	    Product	    Owner,	    and	    responsible	    for	    the	    overall	    project,	    the	   author	   acted	   as	   the	   Scrum	   master.	    	   5.3	   Defining	   Functional	   Requirements	   for	   VisiLean	   Defining	   functional	   requirements	   is	   one	   of	   the	   first	   steps	   following	   initial	   concept	   definition.	    Based	    on	    the	    requirements	    definition,	    system	    requirements	    are	   generated.	   For	   the	   sake	   of	   simplicity,	   these	   two	   steps	   are	   shown	   together	   in	   the	   discussion	    below	    along	    with	    the	    screenshots	    of	    the	    prototype.	    The	    functional	   requirements	   were	   defined	   through	   the	   following	   steps:	   • Discussions	   with	   potential	   end	   users	   of	   system	   • Study	    of	    previous	    production	    management	    system	    and	    literature	    (as	   reported	   in	   5.1)	   • Discussion	   among	   the	   development	   team	   The	   following	   section	   lists	   the	   Product	   Requirements	   for	   VisiLean.	   Requirements	   are	   divided	   into	   the	   following	   sections:	   • User	    Interface	    requirements.	    These	    are	    requirements	    for	    the	    user	   interface,	   which	   may	   be	   expressed	   as	   a	   list,	   as	   a	   narrative,	   or	   as	   images	   of	   screen	   mock-­‐ups.	   • Functional	   requirements.	   These	   are	   requirements	   written	   from	   the	   point	   of	   view	   of	   end	   users,	   usually	   expressed	   in	   narrative	   form.	   • System	    and	    Integration	    requirements.	    These	    are	    detailed	    specifications	   describing	   the	   functions	   the	   system	   should	   be	   capable	   of	   doing.	   5.3.1	   User	   Interface	   Design	   Designing	   the	   user	   interface	   is	   one	   of	   the	   most	   important	   tasks	   of	   system	   design,	   as	   the	   user	   interface	   shapes	   the	   experience	   of	   the	   user	   with	   the	   system.	   The	   user	   interface	    should	    shield	    the	    user	    from	    the	    complexity	    of	    the	    computing	    system	   underneath	   and	   make	   the	   overall	   experience	   rewarding.	   If	   the	   user	   interface	   is	   too	   complex	   the	   users	   may	   be	   put	   off	   due	   to	   a	   steep	   learning	   curve	   and	   amount	   of	   time	   taken	   to	   complete	   functions.	    	   For	    a	    production	    management	    system,	    a	    simple	    and	    intuitive	    user	    interface	    is	   quite	   important	   due	   to	   the	   following	   reasons:	   • Busy	    nature	    of	    construction	    professionals,	    especially	    due	    to	    a	    highly	   dynamic	    site	    environment	    and	    significant	    amount	    of	    information	    they	   have	   to	   deal	   with.	   • Varying	    ICT	    skills	    as	    literacy	    (as	    such	    and	    also	    in	    terms	    of	    the	   familiarisation	   with	   computer	   systems)	   remains	   uneven	   in	   the	   industry.	   • Highly	    complex	    systems	    may	    add	    to	    the	    variability	    of	    the	    process	    and	   have	   a	   negative	   impact	   of	   productivity,	   which	   will	   lead	   to	   its	   failure.	   As	   a	   result,	   importance	   was	   placed	   on	   making	   the	   system	   simple	   and	   intuitive	   to	   use.	   The	   following	   process	   was	   followed	   while	   designing	   the	   user	   interface.	    	   5.3.1.1	   General	   User	   Interface	   As	   the	   VisiLean	   system	   used	   an	   external	   BIM	   platform	   to	   link	   the	   product	   model	   (BIM)	   to	   the	   Lean	   Process,	   there	   were	   three	   possibilities.	   The	   first	   option	   was	   to	   have	    VisiLean	    as	    a	    plugin	    by	    building	    an	    external	    interface	    that	    will	    integrate	   with	    the	    BIM	    application.	    The	    second	    option	    was	    to	    build	    a	    self	    containing	   application	   that	   will	   access	   the	   product	   model	   (BIM)	   through	   an	   API	   (Application	   Programming	    Interface).	    Finally,	    the	    third	    option	    to	    build	    a	    product	    model	   visualisation	   interface	   (i.e.	   a	   BIM	   visualisation	   platform)	   from	   scratch.	   Here,	   to	   ensure	   simplicity	   and	   reduce	   the	   number	   of	   different	   interfaces	   (and	   windows)	   a	   user	   will	   have	   to	   deal	   with,	   it	   was	   decided	   that	   a	   self-­‐contained	   application	   that	   accesses	   the	   BIM	   through	   an	   API	   was	   the	   best	   option.	    	   Also,	    to	    minimise	    having	    windows	    that	    pop-­‐up	    to	    support	    various	    system	   functions,	    a	    tabbed	    interface	    was	    chosen,	    with	    each	    collaborative	    planning	   function	   namely	   phase,	   look-­‐ahead	   and	   weekly	   will	   have	   a	   tab	   of	   its	   own	   along	   with	    the	    general	    administration	    and	    reporting	    functions.	    This	    will	    ensure	   uniformity	   in	   the	   user	   interface	   and	   improve	   the	   system	   workflow.	    	   As	    the	    VisiLean	    system	    deploys	    a	    highly	    visual	    interface,	    the	    icons	    are	    also	   designed	   in	   a	   visual	   way	   so	   that	   the	   meaning	   of	   each	   icon	   becomes	   obvious	   by	   looking	   at	   it.	   For	   example,	   the	   equipment	   icon	   has	   a	   picture	   of	   a	   crane	   to	   provide	   a	    immediate	    visual	    feedback	    to	    the	    user.	    Also,	    in	    VisiLean	    colours	    are	    used	    to	   indicate	    the	    status	    of	    the	    task,	    activity	    or	    a	    phase.	    For	    example,	    in	    either	    the	   planning	    or	    BIM	    application	    the	    colour	    coding	    of	    a	    production	    item	    has	    the	   following	   meaning:	   • Red	   depicts	   the	   production	   item	   as	   “not	   ready”	   • Light	   Green,	   means	   it	   is	   ready	   for	   execution	   • Dark	   Green	   –	   it	   is	   complete	   • Blue	   –	   It	   is	   under	   process	   • Yellow	   –	   work	   has	   stopped	   When	    designing	    VisiLean,	    it	    was	    considered	    that	    a	    “Master-­‐Detail”	    interface	   would	   be	   deployed,	   i.e.	   when	   a	   user	   makes	   a	   top	   level	   selection	   (for	   example	   the	   name	   of	   the	   project,	   a	   particular	   organisation,	   or	   a	   system	   user),	   relevant	   details	   will	    be	    displayed	    either	    at	    the	    bottom	    of	    the	    screen	    or	    on	    the	    right	    side,	   depending	   on	   the	   context.	   This	   makes	   it	   easier	   to	   navigate	   the	   system	   and	   access	   information,	   compared	   to	   the	   method	   where	   a	   new	   window	   is	   opened	   each	   time	   user	   wants	   to	   view	   the	   details	   of	   a	   certain	   item.	   5.3.1.2	   Process	   and	   Product	   Management	   in	   the	   same	   application	   window	   One	   of	   the	   main	   considerations	   while	   devising	   the	   new	   production	   management	   system	    was	    the	    integration	    between	    the	    product	    and	    process	    management	   aspects.	   If	   these	   two	   representations	   are	   in	   two	   separate	   windows	   or	   in	   separate	   applications,	   it	   would	   not	   serve	   the	   original	   purpose	   of	   the	   application.	   Hence,	   it	   was	   decided	   that	   the	   main	   application	   would	   be	   split	   in	   two	   sections,	   where	   the	   product	    model	    (i.e.	    BIM)	    would	    be	    located	    on	    the	    right	    side,	    and	    the	    lean	   production	   management	   features	   would	   be	   situated	   on	   the	   left	   of	   the	   application.	   Further	   details	   of	   the	   integration	   and	   visual	   feedback	   are	   provided	   in	   subsequent	   paragraphs.	   5.3.1.3	   Deploying	   a	   status	   window	   at	   the	   bottom	   It	   is	   considered	   good	   practice	   to	   provide	   users,	   feedback	   about	   the	   actions	   they	   perform	    in	    the	    system;	    however,	    this	    should	    be	    done	    in	    a	    discreet	    and	    non-­intrusive	   way	   so	   that	   it	   doesn’t	   interfere	   with	   the	   main	   functions	   of	   the	   system.	   For	   this	   reason,	   a	   status	   bar	   has	   been	   designed,	   which	   is	   positioned	   at	   the	   bottom	   of	   the	   screen	   and	   provides	   feedback	   on	   user	   actions	   such	   as:	   • The	   selected	   object	   (i.e.	   a	   project,	   a	   task	   etc.)	   • Status	   of	   the	   last	   performed	   action	   (did	   it	   succeed,	   etc.)	   • Progress	   bar,	   if	   there	   is	   an	   on-­‐going	   process.	   5.3.1.4	   Familiar	   planning	   interface	   (to	   match	   leading	   planning	   applications)	   As	    the	    VisiLean	    application	    is	    a	    production	    management	    application	    that	   implements	    collaborative	    planning	    features,	    there	    is	    a	    significant	    emphasis	    on	   planning	    and	    scheduling	    activities	    in	    the	    system.	    The	    collaborative	    planning	   functions	    extend	    the	    traditional	    Master	    Planning	    activities	    (such	    as	    the	    CPM),	   where	    applications	    such	    as	    Microsoft	    Project™	    and	    Oracle	    Primavera	    Project	   Planner™	   are	   used	   extensively	   within	   the	   industry.	   It	   was	   considered	   that	   while	   designing	   the	   planning	   and	   scheduling	   activities,	   the	   familiar	   planning	   interface	   should	    be	    deployed	    with	    additional	    features	    (such	    as	    constraints	    analysis	    and	   integration	   with	   BIM).	   By	   doing	   so,	   the	   users	   will	   quickly	   familiarise	   themselves	   with	    the	    activities	    and	    focus	    directly	    on	    the	    new	    features	    such	    as	    constraints	   analysis	   and	   BIM,	   hence	   reducing	   the	   time	   associated	   in	   learning	   a	   new	   system.	   5.3.1.5	   Touch	   friendly	   With	    the	    developments	    in	    the	    mobile	    computing	    sector,	    especially	    with	    the	   devices	   such	   as	   tablets	   and	   smart	   phones,	   screens	   with	   multi-­‐touch	   capabilities	   are	   becoming	   increasingly	   popular.	   Many	   such	   devices	   now	   offer	   functionalities	   such	    as	    “pinch	    to	    zoom	    in	    or	    zoom	    out”,	    rotating	    the	    picture	    or	    other	    screen	   artefact	   (such	   as	   a	   map)	   with	   two	   fingers,	   etc.	   Also,	   selecting	   and	   manipulating	   items	    with	    fingers	    rather	    than	    using	    the	    traditional	    keyboard	    and	    mouse	    is	   becoming	   commonplace	   for	   computer	   users.	   As	   the	   newly	   designed	   production	   management	   system	   is	   intended	   to	   be	   used	   on	   the	   construction	   site	   where	   a	   computing	   skills	   of	   workers	   could	   vary	   greatly,	   it	   was	   considered	   that	   the	   system	   should	   be	   touch	   friendly.	   However,	   as	   initially	   the	   system	   will	   be	   deployed	   using	   a	   traditional	   computing	   platform	   (rather	   than	   a	   mobile	   platform),	   it	   was	   envisaged	   that	   a	   combination	   of	   traditional	   and	   touch	   friendly	   methods	   should	   be	   used.	   This	   would	   be	   achieved	   by	   using	   a	   system	   on	   a	   large	   screen	   such	   as	   a	   42”	   plasma	   or	   LCD/LED	   screen	   and	   using	   a	   touch	   overlay.	   In	    VisiLean,	    the	    touch	    friendly	    features	    are	    also	    available	    on	    the	    BIM	    window	   where	   it	   is	   possible	   to	   Zoom,	   Select,	   Pan	   or	   Tilt	   the	   model	   using	   fingers.	   In	   terms	   of	   the	   further	   development	   of	   planned	   mobile	   interfaces	   with	   VisiLean	   system,	   it	   is	   envisaged	   that	   an	   improved	   touch	   interface	   will	   be	   deployed	   that	   will	   enable	   multi-­‐touch	   capabilities	   in	   the	   planning	   window	   and	   deploy	   features	   such	   as	   electronic	   Post-­‐It™	   notes,	   where	   each	   task	   is	   represented	   using	   a	   note	   and	   users	   can	   move	   these	   around	   during	   planning/scheduling	   sessions	   to	   change	   their	    sequence	    and	    immediately	    get	    a	    feedback	    of	    the	    change,	    similar	    to	    the	   manual	   collaborative	   planning	   exercise.	    	   5.3.2	   BIM/Product	   Visualisation	   Capability	   Selection	   of	   a	   BIM	   platform	   and	   the	   product	   visualisation	   capability	   is	   one	   of	   the	   most	   important	   factors	   while	   designing	   the	   VisiLean	   system.	   There	   are	   a	   number	   of	    factors	    that	    were	    considered	    while	    selecting	    a	    platform,	    and	    are	    discussed	   below.	   5.3.2.1	   Acceptability	   of	   Major	   BIM	   File	   Formats	   There	   is	   a	   wide	   range	   of	   BIM	   platforms	   in	   use	   currently,	   with	   majority	   of	   them	   using	    proprietary	    file	    formats,	    and	    much	    varied	    IFC	    (Industry	    Foundation	   Classes)	    compatibility.	    Any	    construction	    project	    will	    make	    use	    of	    a	    number	    of	   BIM	   models,	   including	   that	   of	   the	   Architect,	   Structural	   and	   HVAC.	   There	   will	   be	   tasks,	    which	    would	    be	    associated	    with	    each	    of	    these	    models;	    hence	    their	   availability	    in	    the	    production	    management	    system	    (VisiLean)	    is	    essential.	    This	   makes	   it	   highly	   important	   that	   any	   system	   chosen	   should	   be	   capable	   of	   accepting	   all	   major	   BIM	   file	   formats	   in	   use.	   All	    major	    commercial	    and	    non-­‐commercial	    (open	    source	    and	    research	    based)	   products	    were	    considered	    for	    integration	    in	    VisiLean	    from	    this	    point	    of	    view,	   along	   with	   other	   requirements	   listed	   below	   (and	   also	   the	   availability	   of	   an	   API	   to	   integrate	    it	    within	    the	    VisiLean	    application).	    Table	    21	    summarises	    the	   comparison	   between	   all	   the	   systems	   considered.	   Table	   21.

From	    the	    point	    of	    view	    of	    a	    production	    management	    system	    the	    following	   capabilities	   are	   considered	   essential:	   • Panning	   • Zooming	   • Rotating	   (Orbiting)	   • Selecting	   components	   and	   • Walking	   As	    these	    are	    some	    of	    the	    most	    basic	    navigation	    functions,	    most	    applications	   reviewed	    implement	    these	    functions.	    It	    is	    also	    important	    that	    the	    navigation	   controls	    are	    available	    in	    the	    API	    (Application	    Programming	    Interface)	    so	    that	   they	    can	    be	    used	    within	    the	    VisiLean	    application.	    Figure	    28	    shows	    the	    BIM	   window	   in	   VisiLean,	   which	   implements	   these	   navigation	   functions	   as	   can	   be	   seen	   at	   the	   top	   of	   the	   screen.	   	   	   Figure	   28.	   The	   BIM	   Window	   in	   VisiLean.	   5.3.2.3	   Simulating	   Look-­‐ahead	   and	   Weekly	   Planning	   (4D)	   capability	   4D	    planning	    as	    described	    in	    Chapter	    4,	    is	    a	    technique	    where	    the	    construction	   plan	   is	   linked	   to	   the	   Building	   Information	   Model	   and	   simulated	   against	   time	   to	   visualise	   the	   plan	   and	   carry	   out	   constructability	   analysis.	   This	   capability	   is	   also	   essential	    from	    a	    production	    management	    system	    perspective	    and	    hence	   desirable	   in	   the	   VisiLean	   system.	   While	   all	   the	   leading	   BIM	   systems	   can	   simulate	   the	   plan	   at	   a	   higher	   –	   Master	   Plan	   level,	   with	   VisiLean,	   the	   aim	   is	   to	   simulate	   the	   plan	   at	   the	   lower	   look-­‐ahead	   and	   weekly	   (and	   even	   daily)	   levels.	   This	   provides	   an	   opportunity	   to	   carry	   out	   constructability	   analysis	   and	   process	   clash	   checking	   at	   a	   much	   finer	   level	   of	   resolution.	   5.3.2.4	   Quantity	   and	   Cost	   Take-­‐off	   from	   model	   elements	   One	   of	   the	   important	   aspects	   of	   having	   the	   Building	   Information	   Model	   available	   in	   the	   production	   management	   system	   is	   to	   have	   the	   product	   related	   information	   available	   on	   demand.	   In	   the	   early	   demonstrations	   to	   potential	   users,	   it	   was	   made	   clear	   that	   having	   quantity	   and	   cost	   related	   information	   was	   very	   important	   for	   the	    users.	    The	    potential	    workflow	    would	    be	    that	    when	    a	    task	    is	    linked	    to	    the	   corresponding	    BIM	    element,	    the	    quantity	    (and	    cost)	    information	    will	    be	   extracted	    automatically	    from	    the	    element	    and	    displayed	    with	    other	    task	   information.	   It	   should	   also	   be	   possible	   to	   keep	   a	   track	   of	   the	   actual	   consumption	   of	   resources,	   hence	   quantities	   and	   costs.	    	   There	   was	   also	   a	   request	   from	   potential	   users	   to	   link	   Tender	   (Bid)	   quantities,	   costs	   and	   resources	   to	   the	   tasks,	   to	   compare	   with	   the	   actual	   and	   help	   generate	   reports	   such	   as	   Cost	   Value	   Reconciliation	   (CVR)	   automatically	   from	   the	   system.	    	   5.3.3	   Product	   and	   Process	   Integration	   Capability	   In	    VisiLean,	    product	    and	    process	    integration	    is	    one	    of	    the	    most	    important	   aspects.	   It	   is	   here,	   that	   the	   production	   management	   process	   is	   integrated	   with	   the	   product	   model	   in	   a	   visual	   way,	   enabling	   graphical	   representation	   of	   where	   operations	   are	   physically	   located	   within	   a	   project	   and	   how	   they	   are	   progressing.	   This	    borrows	    from	    a	    lean	    production	    principle,	    namely	    ‘visual	    management’	   (Tezel,	    2010),	    whereby	    a	    number	    of	    visual	    devices	    are	    used	    to	    convey	   information	   about	   the	   workplace	   and	   to	   manage	   it.	   For	   example,	   the	   popup	   that	   relates	    to	    a	    task	    (a	    type	    of	    operation	    within	    VisiLean)	    has	    action	    buttons	    that	   allow	   users	   to	   change	   the	   status	   of	   the	   task	   by	   marking	   it	   as	   started	   or	   stopped	   etc.	   These	   buttons	   are	   inactive	   if	   the	   task’s	   current	   status	   doesn’t	   indicate	   that	   it	   is	   ready	   for	   execution.	   This	   feature	   is	   similar	   to	   the	   concept	   of	   a	   device	   known	   as	   poka-­‐yoke,	   which	   roughly	   translates	   from	   the	   original	   Japanese	   as	   mistake-­‐proof	   or	   fail-­‐safe.	   The	   very	   act	   of	   placing	   a	   task	   popup	   adjacent	   to	   the	   model	   elements	   to	    which	    it	    relates,	    with	    those	    elements	    highlighted,	    is	    another	    visual	   management	    device	    in	    which	    the	    workplace	    becomes	    self	    describing:	    ‘this	    is	   where	   to	   carry	   out	   task	   xyz,	   and	   these	   are	   the	   building	   elements	   involved’.	   The	   visual	   task	   representation	   is	   designed	   to	   make	   it	   easier	   for	   those	   in	   collaborative	   planning	   meetings	   and	   those	   actually	   carrying	   out	   the	   work	   to	   see	   how	   the	   task	   relates	   to	   others	   in	   the	   same	   area	   and	   to	   record	   progress	   towards	   its	   completion.	   The	   following	   describes	   how	   the	   product	   and	   process	   integration	   is	   achieved	   in	   VisiLean.	   5.3.3.1	   Linking	   tasks	   to	   model	   elements	   Likewise	   in	   4D	   planning,	   in	   VisiLean	   the	   tasks	   and	   sub-­‐tasks	   are	   linked	   to	   their	   respective	   elements	   in	   the	   BIM	   model.	   This	   enables	   a	   spatial	   representation	   of	   the	    task	    in	    the	    model	    and	    helps	    visualise	    the	    task	    in	    a	    better	    way.	    Figure	    28	   shows	    the	    BIM	    window	    in	    VisiLean,	    with	    the	    Element	    Filters	    selection	    box	   expanded	    and	    also	    the	    Task	    Pop-­‐up	    window	    in	    the	    centre	    of	    the	    screen.	    The	   following	    functionalities	    is	    available	    when	    the	    task	    and	    model	    element	    are	   linked:	   	   • Displaying	   process	   status	   on	   the	   model	   (individual	   tasks	   and	   phases):	   Once	    linked,	    the	    element	    in	    BIM	    changes	    its	    colour	    to	    correspond	    to	    the	   colour	    that	    represents	    the	    task	    status	    (i.e.	    red,	    green,	    blue,	    etc.).	    Also,	    as	   shown	   in	   Figure	   28,	   the	   status	   icon	   displaying	   task	   information	   is	   attached	   to	   the	   BIM	   element.	   By	   linking	   the	   process	   and	   product	   information	   in	   such	   a	   way,	   it	   is	   possible	   to	   visualise	   the	   status	   of	   the	   production	   at	   any	   given	   point	   in	   time,	   and	   also	   resolve	   any	   process	   clashes	   arising	   during	   execution.	   This	   also	   helps	   visualise	   the	   following	   information:	   o The	   organisation,	   or	   person	   responsible	   to	   carry	   out	   the	   task	   o Name	   of	   the	   task	   o Priority	   of	   the	   task	   o Status	   of	   the	   task	   o Any	   constraints	   linked	   to	   the	   task	   and	   their	   status	   • Zooming	   into	   selected	   elements:	   Once	   the	   production	   item	   (a	   phase,	   task	   or	   an	   activity)	   and	   the	   BIM	   element	   are	   linked,	   each	   time	   the	   production	   item	   is	    selected,	    the	    system	    will	    automatically	    select	    and	    zoom	    into	    the	   corresponding	    BIM	    elements.	    The	    system	    will	    also	    make	    other	    elements	   transparent	   (up	   to	   a	   degree)	   so	   that	   the	   visualisation	   is	   easier.	   • Simulating	   a	   selection	   of	   tasks	   in	   4D:	   Once	   all	   the	   tasks	   and	   subtasks	   are	   linked	   to	   their	   corresponding	   elements,	   it	   would	   be	   possible	   to	   simulate	   the	   construction	   sequence	   in	   4D	   through	   the	   BIM	   model.	    	   • Up-­‐to-­‐date	    product	    geometry,	    specifications	    and	    other	    technical	   information	   while	   defining	   the	   process:	   When	   the	   tasks	   are	   linked,	   beside	   the	   quantity	   and	   cost	   information,	   all	   other	   relevant	   information	   regarding	   the	   geometry,	   specifications	   and	   specific	   work	   instruction	   that	   is	   linked	   to	   the	   BIM	   model	   should	   be	   made	   available	   to	   the	   task	   information.	    	   5.3.3.2	   Setting	   Task	   Status	   Communication	    between	    workers	    during	    execution	    is	    critical,	    especially	    to	   ensure	    that	    the	    flow	    between	    activities	    is	    continuous	    and	    workers	    get	   notifications	   once	   the	   predecessor	   task	   is	   completed.	   In	   VisiLean,	   each	   task	   has	   four	    individual	    statuses,	    which	    are	    activated	    by	    pressing	    the	    corresponding	   button	    in	    the	    software,	    either	    in	    the	    software	    window	    or	    in	    the	    BIM	    window.	   Figure	   29	   displays	   the	   task	   status	   window	   as	   it	   is	   implemented	   in	   VisiLean.	   	   Figure	   29.	   The	   Task	   Status	   window	   in	   VisiLean.	   The	   task	   status	   update	   is	   possible	   from	   either	   the	   Weekly	   Planning	   module	   or	   from	   the	   status	   window	   on	   the	   BIM	   Model	   viewer.	   The	   statuses	   are	   described	   below.	   • Started:	   Pressing	   the	   start	   button,	   starts	   the	   task	   and	   changes	   the	   colour	   of	   the	    task	    in	    plan	    window	    and	    also	    the	    corresponding	    element	    in	    the	    BIM	   window	   to	   blue.	   • Mark	    for	    Attention	    (also	    see	    Andon	    section	    below):	    When	    this	    button	    is	   pressed,	    the	    relevant	    line	    manger	    (foreman,	    site	    manager	    or	    project	   manager),	   gets	   a	   notification	   of	   an	   imminent	   problem	   and	   attempts	   to	   rectify	   the	   situation	   before	   the	   work	   has	   to	   be	   stopped.	   The	   colour	   in	   both	   windows	   changes	   to	   yellow.	   • Stopped:	    When	   pressing	   this	   button,	   the	   workers	   have	   to	   provide	   a	   reason	   why	    they	    are	    stopping	    the	    task.	    Once	    stopped,	    similar	    to	    the	    “mark	    for	   attention”	    button,	    the	    relevant	    line	    manager(s)	    get	    the	    notification	    so	    that	   they	    can	    respond	    accordingly	    to	    get	    the	    production	    back	    on	    line.	    At	    each	   weekly	   meeting,	   the	   reasons	   for	   stopping	   tasks	   are	   aggregated	   and	   analysed	   so	   that	   lessons	   can	   be	   learnt.	   The	   tasks	   marked	   with	   this	   status	   change	   their	   colour	   to	   red	   in	   both	   windows.	   • Complete:	   Completing	   a	   task	   sets	   the	   colour	   to	   dark	   green	   and	   sends	   a	   signal	   to	   the	   next	   worker	   in	   line	   (if	   any)	   that	   they	   can	   now	   start	   the	   work.	   However,	   this	   notification	   will	   only	   be	   sent	   if	   all	   the	   other	   constraints	   for	   the	   next	   task	   are	   removed.	    	   • Add	   notes:	   It	   is	   possible	   to	   add	   notes	   to	   tasks	   in	   VisiLean	   when	   changes	   are	   being	   made	   or	   to	   record	   any	   relevant	   information	   during	   execution.	    	   5.3.3.3	   Electronic	   Andon	   Andon	   refers	   to	   a	   visual	   system	   that	   is	   used	   to	   highlight	   the	   status	   of	   production	   at	    any	    given	    point	    in	    time,	    and	    consists	    of	    a	    notice	    board	    showing	    different	   production	    areas	    and	    their	    individual	    statuses	    and	    control	    buttons	    (or	    other	   similar	    mechanisms)	    which	    workers	    use	    to	    indicate	    the	    current	    status.	    For	   example,	    in	    an	    apartment	    construction	    project,	    each	    floor	    could	    have	    three	   buttons:	   • Green:	   production	   is	   progressing	   as	   normal	   • Yellow:	   a	   problem	   is	   imminent	   • Red:	   Production	   has	   been	   stopped	   The	   main	   idea	   is	   that	   the	   person(s)	   responsible	   can	   then	   respond	   the	   problem	   before	   the	   work	   has	   to	   be	   stopped,	   and	   the	   communication	   happens	   efficiently,	   instead	   of	   worker(s)	   having	   to	   walk	   all	   the	   way	   to	   a	   managers	   cabin	   to	   notify	   of	   a	   problem.	    	   In	   VisiLean,	   the	   equivalent	   of	   physical	   Andon	   board	   is	   conceptualised.	   Each	   task	   has	    a	    corresponding	    button	    to	    flag	    imminent	    problems.	    Once	    pressed	    the	   relevant	    line	    manager	    is	    sent	    a	    notification	    so	    that	    appropriate	    actions	    can	    be	   taken.	   Similarly	   to	   the	   physical	   Andon	   notice	   board,	   a	   large	   screen	   in	   the	   main	   office	   could	   be	   installed	   to	   show	   the	   status	   of	   the	   production	   at	   any	   given	   point	   in	   time	   (with	   colour	   coded	   model	   overlaid	   with	   task	   status	   information).	    	   5.4	   Specifying	   the	   VisiLean	   System	   In	   the	   following,	   the	   parts	   of	   VisiLean	   system	   are	   specified	   and	   discussed.	   Also,	   the	    sequence	    in	    which	    they	    were	    tackled	    and	    relevant	    screenshots	    from	    the	   prototype	   are	   provided.	   5.4.1	   Project	   Administration	   As	    production	    management	    is	    an	    information	    intensive	    process,	    a	    significant	   amount	   of	   information	   has	   to	   be	   managed	   in	   order	   for	   it	   to	   function	   smoothly.	   The	   Project	   Administration	   section	   handles	   all	   the	   information	   associated	   with	   the	    project	    that	    is	    relevant	    to	    the	    production	    management	    aspect.	    This	   essentially	    means	    the	    definition	    and	    management	    of	    Project	    Resources,	    which	   might	    include	    Personnel,	    Information,	    Equipment,	    Materials,	    Components	    and	   the	   Spaces	   defined	   within	   and/or	   around	   the	   proposed	   structure	   (these	   are	   the	   terms	    used	    in	    VisiLean	    and	    differentiated	    with	    a	    title	    case).	    In	    essence,	   information	   that	   is	   necessary	   to	   carry	   out	   constraints	   analysis	   during	   production	   management.	   As	    most	    such	    information	    resides	    in	    electronic/computer	    systems	    within	   stakeholder	   organisations,	   the	   ideal	   way	   to	   manage	   it	   would	   be	   to	   integrate	   such	   information	   directly	   within	   VisiLean	   to	   minimise	   manual	   data	   entry.	   However,	   due	   to	   the	   lack	   of	   live	   sample	   data	   and	   limited	   access	   to	   construction	   information	   systems	   within	   partner	   companies,	   in	   the	   first	   iteration	   of	   the	   software,	   all	   such	   Resources	    have	    to	    be	    manually	    input	    to	    the	    system	    by	    users.	    The	    information	   required	   includes	   name	   and	   description	   for	   the	   Resource,	   when	   it	   is	   anticipated	   that	   it	   will	   be	   delivered	   to	   the	   project,	   whether	   or	   not	   it	   is	   available	   at	   any	   given	   moment	    in	    the	    project	    and	    what	    task,	    if	    any,	    within	    the	    project	    a	    Resource	    is	   currently	   assigned	   to.	    	   In	   future	   development	   of	   VisiLean,	   it	   is	   envisaged	   that	   a	   large	   proportion	   of	   this	   information	    will	    be	    derived	    from	    third	    party	    data	    systems	    via	    web	    service	   interfaces	    designed	    to	    extract	    the	    relevant	    information	    from	    those	    systems.	   Further,	   whilst	   at	   present	   the	   anticipated	   and	   actual	   delivery	   dates	   for	   a	   resource	   are	   input	   and	   updated	   manually,	   it	   is	   intended	   that	   where	   possible	   this	   should	   be	   achieved	   via	   a	   live	   or	   semi—live	   link	   to	   external	   systems	   such	   that	   information	   coming	   from	   product	   suppliers	   etc.	   is	   automatically	   incorporated	   into	   VisiLean	   ensuring	   that	   it	   is	   always	   up	   to	   date.	   Such	   a	   link	   would	   be	   implemented	   using	   web	   services,	   both	   the	   WSDL/SOAP	   (W3C	   2001,	   2007)	   and	   REST	   (Fielding	   2000)	   varieties	   as	   necessary	   for	   integration	   of	   external	   systems	   into	   the	   workflow	   of	   the	    project.	    Further	    discussion	    about	    web	    services	    and	    database	    management	   can	   be	   found	   under	   the	   Section	   5.5.

In	   Figure	   31	   the	   screen	   shows	   members	   of	   a	   team	    that	    belongs	    within	    a	    particular	    organisation.	    This	    demonstrates	    the	   organisation	    hierarchy	    (i.e.	    organisation,	    people	    and	    teams).	    Once	    an	   organisation	   is	   created	   within	   VisiLean	   and	   people	   added	   to	   that	   organisation,	   the	   team	   creation	   window	   will	   show	   the	   available	   people	   to	   choose	   from	   in	   the	   Team	   Selection	   dialog	   box.

It	    was	    anticipated	    (and	   feedback	   received	   to	   the	   same	   effect)	   that	   the	   contractors	   would	   continue	   using	   their	   respective	   planning	   applications	   such	   as	   Microsoft™	   Project	   or	   Primavera™	   Project	   Planner.	   The	   VisiLean	   application	   aims	   to	   support	   the	   planning	   workflow	   that	   stems	   from	   Phase	   Planning	   onwards.	   To	   ensure	   minimal	   rework,	   a	   facility	   to	   import	    existing	    plans	    from	    above	    mentioned	    applications	    has	    been	   recommended.	    The	    planning	    process	    in	    VisiLean	    consists	    of	    the	    following	   modules:	   • Phase	   Planning	   • Look-­‐ahead	   Planning	   • Weekly	   Commitment	   Planning	   One	    of	    the	    most	    important	    aspects	    of	    the	    Last	    Planner™	    system	    is	    the	   collaborative	    planning	    and	    scheduling	    approach	    it	    facilitates	    among	    the	    site	   team.	    A	    number	    of	    studies	    have	    suggested	    that	    this	    particular	    aspect	    of	   collaborative	   planning	   increases	   trust	   and	   improves	   the	   reliability	   of	   planning	   to	   a	   great	   extent.	   During	   initial	   discussions	   with	   the	   industry	   practitioners	   who	   had	   prior	   experience	   in	   implementing	   the	   Last	   Planner™	   system,	   it	   emerged	   that	   they	   strongly	   recommended	   keeping	   this	   collaboration	   aspect	   “as	   is”	   and	   in	   a	   “face-­‐to-­face”	   setting.	   Although	   it	   is	   possible	   to	   replace	   the	   physical	   meeting	   to	   a	   virtual	   meeting,	    this	    request	    was	    acknowledged	    in	    VisiLean	    research,	    and	    hence	    the	   system	    was	    not	    designed	    to	    replace	    this	    “face-­‐to-­‐face”	    collaboration,	    rather	    to	   support	   it.	   Through	    the	    use	    of	    VisiLean	    system,	    the	    collaborative	    planning	    process	    is	   strengthened	   by	   simultaneous	   viewing	   (by	   the	   Last	   Planners)	   of	   the	   Phase,	   Look-­ahead	    and	    Weekly	    plans,	    and	    the	    Building	    Information	    Model	    through	    a	   projected	    screen	    or	    a	    large	    television	    on	    site.	    During	    these	    meetings,	    the	    Last	   Planners	    will	    negotiate	    with	    each	    other	    the	    sequencing	    and	    other	    execution	   related	    issues,	    and	    also	    agree	    who	    will	    bear	    the	    responsibility	    in	    removal	    of	   constraints.	   As	   shown	   in	   Figure	   4	   in	   Appendix	   C,	   the	   task	   filtering	   helps	   to	   select	   relevant	   tasks	   during	   the	   planning	   sessions,	   so	   that	   certain	   actions	   can	   be	   taken	   such	   as	   addition	   of	   constraints	   or	   releasing	   the	   task	   to	   the	   execution	   week,	   etc.	   The	   system	   records	   the	   person	   (or	   team)	   responsible	   for	   managing	   the	   task	   in	   the	    Look-­‐ahead	    and	    Weekly	    plans.	    It	    is	    envisaged	    that	    In	    a	    future	    version	    of	   Visilean,	    a	    distributed	    access	    system	    will	    enable	    subcontractors	    to	    login	    and	   manage	   their	   own	   part	   of	   the	   production	   plan	   and	   constraints.	    	   The	   Phase,	   Look-­‐ahead	   and	   Weekly	   planning	   workflow	   is	   explained	   in	   detail	   in	   Section	   5.4.2.1,	   5.4.2.2	   and	   5.4.2.3,	   respectively.	   The	    activity	    tab	    area	    supports	    a	    process	    of	    work	    planning	    from	    initial	    phase	   definition	   through	   collaborative	   sessions	   to	   define	   look-­‐ahead	   and	   weekly	   plans	   based	    on	    current	    information	    regarding	    resource	    availability	    and	    defined	   priorities	    for	    tasks.	    The	    application	    does	    not	    automatically	    select	    tasks	    which	   should	   appear	   in	   look-­‐ahead	   and	   weekly	   plans	   beyond	   filtering	   to	   those	   which	   fall	   wholly	   or	   partly	   within	   the	   requisite	   date	   ranges,	   the	   final	   decisions	   being	   left	   to	   those	   involved	   in	   the	   collaborative	   planning	   meetings.	   The	   BIM	   model	   viewer	   shows	   graphically,	   which	   model	   elements	   are	   related	   to	   which	   tasks	   in	   the	   project	   plan.	    	    This	   is	   achieved	   by	   selecting	   the	   relevant	   model	   elements	   in	   the	   viewer	   window,	   which	   brings	   a	   popup	   window	   with	   the	   name	   of	   the	   task	   or	   sub-­‐task	   related	   to	   those	   elements.	   The	   popup	   window	   also	   displays	   a	   description	   for	   the	   task,	   its	   status,	   the	   project	   parties	   responsible	   for	   the	   task	   and	   the	   actions	   that	   are	   possible	   for	   the	   task	   such	   as	   start,	   stop	   and	   mark	   complete.	   These	    windows	    will	    eventually	    display	    a	    broader	    range	    of	    information	    about	   prerequisites	    for	    the	    task.	    The	    functional	    requirements,	    specifications	    and	   screenshots	   for	   each	   of	   these	   modules	   are	   provided	   below.	   5.4.2.1	   Phase	   Planning	   The	    phase	    planning	    in	    VisiLean	    provides	    equivalent	    functionality	    to	    that	    of	   “reverse	   phase	   scheduling”	   as	   in	   the	   Last	   Planner™	   process.	   The	   main	   purpose	   of	   “reverse	   phase	   scheduling”	   is	   to	   bring	   together	   the	   whole	   project	   team	   and	   work	   backwards	   to	   reach	   an	   agreement	   on	   the	   overall	   project	   sequence	   for	   a	   chosen	   duration	   (typically	   3-­‐6	   months).	    	    	   In	   VisiLean	   the	   overall	   structure	   of	   the	   project	   plan	   can	   be	   defined	   down	   to	   any	   level	   of	   activity,	   i.e.	   a	   user	   can	   define	   phases,	   tasks,	   sub-­‐tasks	   to	   the	   nth	   level	   as	   an	   activity.	    Alternatively	    activities	    can	    be	    added	    directly	    in	    the	    subsequent	    look-­ahead	   planning	   interface	   as	   and	   when	   they	   are	   identified.	   It	   is	   anticipated	   that	   at	   this	    stage	    a	    Master	    Plan	    will	    be	    imported	    from	    an	    existing	    application.	    While	   importing	    the	    plan,	    existing	    relationships	    between	    tasks	    will	    be	    preserved.	    To	   begin	    with,	    mono-­‐directional	    input	    is	    provided	    for	    (i.e.	    from	    external	   applications	   to	   VisiLean),	   however,	   it	   is	   recommended	   that	   in	   future	   versions	   a	   multi-­‐directional	   link	   should	   be	   provided	   to	   ensure	   that	   the	   changes	   in	   project	   status	   are	   reflected	   in	   the	   Master	   Plan.	   Figure	   32	   and	   Figure	   33	   show	   the	   phase	   planning	   screen	   in	   the	   VisiLean	   prototype,	   where	   the	   tasks	   coloured	   in	   red	   (also	   selected	    in	    BIM)	    are	    the	    “not	    ready”	    tasks	    as	    the	    constraints	    haven’t	    been	   removed,	   whereas	   the	   light	   green	   tasks	   are	   ready,	   dark	   green	   tasks	   are	   complete	   and	    tasks	    coloured	    blue	    have	    started.

In Phase 2 and beyond it is envisaged that the Tasks can be linked to one another with multiple Relationships (with lags) viz (FS-Finish to Start, SS-Start to Start, FF-Finish to Finish and SF-Start to Finish. In Phase 1 defining a Prerequisite amounts to creating a FS relationship 3. In current Phase if the Project and Tasks are imported from Primavera or MS Project, then it is likely that the relationship info may flow in. There is a need to investigate further as to how the imported Relationships will be handled Resource Prerequisites  Add 	resource constraints 1. Add resource constraints to tasks. Resource constraints are created first in the Project Administration tab and are made available in the Phase and Look-Ahead planning tab.  2. Resource constraints could be any of the following: Material, Equipment, Space, Actors (Organisation, Team or individuals), and Information. 3. Also, assigning resource constraint removal responsibility to actors. 5.4.2.2	   Look-­‐Ahead	   Planning	   As	   discussed	   in	   the	   Chapter	   4,	   the	   purpose	   of	   look-­‐ahead	   planning	   is	   to	   create	   a	   workable	    backlog	    of	    “ready”	    tasks,	    which	    are	    free	    of	    constraints.	    It	    is	    a	    highly	   collaborative	   process	   where	   all	   relevant	   stakeholders	   take	   part	   in	   the	   meeting,	   and	    analyse	    the	    tasks	    in	    hand	    to	    identify	    all	    major	    constraints,	    assign	   responsibilities	    for	    their	    removal	    and	    make	    promises	    to	    each	    other	    that	    the	   constraints	   will	   be	   removed	   in	   time.	   In	   this	   meeting	   the	   aspects	   of	   collaboration,	   constraints	   analysis,	   and	   understanding	   the	   sequence	   and	   where	   tasks	   are	   to	   be	   performed	   are	   important.	    	   In	    VisiLean,	    the	    Look-­‐Ahead	    planning	    function	    offers	    the	    capability	    to	    pull	    the	   tasks	   from	   the	   phase	   plan,	   where	   the	   look-­‐ahead	   window	   is	   configurable	   on	   a	   project	   wide	   basis,	   with	   a	   default	   value	   of	   3	   weeks.	   The	   tasks	   selectable	   from	   the	   phase	   plan	   are	   filtered	   by	   date,	   such	   that	   only	   those	   falling	   within	   the	   look-­‐ahead	   window	    are	    available.	    If	    tasks	    have	    not	    yet	    been	    defined,	    it	    is	    also	    possible	    to	   create	    new	    ones	    at	    this	    stage	    and	    assign	    them	    to	    an	    existing	    phase	    whose	   duration	   coincides	   with	   all	   or	   part	   of	   the	   look-­‐ahead	   window.	   As	   with	   other	   tabs,	   the	    selected	    item	    in	    the	    Look-­‐Ahead	    tab	    the	    task	    details	    are	    displayed	    in	    the	   bottom	   (beneath	   the	   activity	   tab	   area).	   The	   Look-­‐Ahead	   workflow	   within	   VisiLean	   is	   presented	   in	   Figure	   34.	   	   Figure	   34.	   Look-­‐ahead	   planning	   workflow	   in	   VisiLean.	   • Pre-­‐meeting	    actions:	    The	    VisiLean	    coordinator	    ensures	    that	    all	    tasks	    are	   defined	   and	   are	   linked	   to	   their	   respective	   elements	   in	   the	   BIM	   model	   o All	   project	   stakeholders	   do	   their	   “homework”	   to	   ensure	   that	   they	   are	   familiar	    with	    what	    is	    being	    planned	    and	    get	    an	    update	    on	    the	   constraints	   • Collaborative	   Meeting:	   The	   VisiLean	   Coordinator	   drives	   the	   system	   during	   the	   meeting	   to	   dropdown	   the	   tasks	   from	   the	   phase	   plan	   into	   the	   Look-­‐Ahead	   plan	   and	   the	   constraints	   are	   added/listed	   by	   subcontractors.	   For	   each	   task	   selected,	   the	   VisiLean	   BIM	   window	   will	   show	   the	   respective	   information.	   The	   following	   actions	   are	   taken	   during	   the	   meeting:	   o The	   constraints	   are	   analysed	   and	   added	   to	   individual	   tasks.	    	   o The	    task	    manager	    commit	    that	    they	    would	    be	    removed	    before	    the	   week	   of	   execution.	   o Any	    decisions	    taken	    to	    remove	    certain	    tasks	    from	    the	    Look-­‐Ahead	   window	   (if	   they	   can’t	   be	   made	   ready	   in	   time)	   are	   also	   recorded	   and	   such	   tasks	   are	   dropped	   back	   to	   the	   phase	   plan	   to	   be	   rescheduled.	   • Follow	    up:	    Following	    the	    Look-­‐Ahead	    meeting,	    each	    actor	    who	    has	    been	   assigned	   the	   responsibility	   of	   removing	   the	   constraints,	   accesses	   the	   system	   to	    tick	    the	    box	    next	    to	    each	    constraint	    to	    indicate	    that	    it	    has	    been	   removed/resolved.	   Once	   all	   constraints	   are	   resolved	   a	   task	   becomes	   “ready”	   and	   can	   be	   released	   to	   the	   weekly	   plan.	   Any	   constraints	   that	   have	   not	   been	   removed	   will	   have	   to	   be	   analysed	   and	   the	   reasons	   recorded.	   One	   of	   the	   more	   important	   follow-­‐up	   actions	   in	   look-­‐ahead	   planning	   in	   VisiLean	   is	   the	   ‘Release	   to	   weekly’	   action	   button.	   This	   action	   is	   only	   available	   for	   a	   given	   task	   once	   all	   the	   prerequisites	   are	   met	   (constraints	   removed)	   and	   it	   is	   ready	   to	   start.	    Initiating	    this	    action	    adds	    the	    selected	    task	    to	    the	    weekly	    plan	    in	   preparation.	   Figure	   35	   shows	   the	   screenshot	   of	   the	   look-­‐ahead	   planning	   window	   in	   VisiLean	   and	   Table	   24	   provides	   a	   description	   of	   the	   system	   specifications	   for	   the	   look-­‐ahead	   module	   in	   VisiLean.	   	   	   	   Figure	   35.

User should be able to pull tasks from the phase plan and schedule them in the look-ahead window. When use clicks on “Select Tasks”, a window should pop-up, which displays all the phases and tasks under the project. User should be able to filter these tasks based on start date and end date, space name, organization name, role name etc. User can multi-select these tasks to pull them in the look-ahead planning. 2. Also, system will automatically populate all the tasks falling in the lookahead window and will give user an option to deselect tasks if he wants to. Task released to weekly Planning User should be able to move the task from look-ahead planning to weekly planning. An action button should be provided to move the selected task from look-ahead planning window to weekly planning window. The button will be enabled only for tasks with a “Ready” status. Task to be marked as Late 1. System should automatically mark the Task as late if the task has not been completed till the Target End Date. This should be a display field and not a checkbox. Currently the prototype has a checkbox for marking the task as late. 2. There should be also a facility to enter new Start or End dates or both 3. Depending on the newly enter dates the Task can/will be moved to relevant week or look ahead plan 5.4.2.3	   Weekly/Commitment	   Planning	   The	    weekly	    planning	    meeting,	    which	    is	    also	    known	    as	    the	    “commitment”	   planning	   meeting,	   is	   organised	   to	   ensure	   that	   only	   the	   constraint	   free	   tasks	   are	   selected	   for	   execution	   during	   next	   week,	   and	   that	   all	   stakeholders	   commit	   to	   the	   tasks	   selected	   and	   the	   sequence	   of	   operation.	   During	   this	   meeting,	   the	   following	   workflow	   is	   followed:	   • Pre-­‐Meeting:	    All	    actors	    responsible	    for	    removal	    of	    constraints	    (during	   the	   Look-­‐Ahead	   window)	   would	   have	   addressed	   the	   constraints	   prior	   to	   the	   meeting.	   The	   tasks	   would	   have	   been	   dropped	   to	   the	   weekly	   plan	   by	   clicking	    the	    “release	    to	    weekly”	    button	    once	    the	    constraints	    have	    been	   removed.	    For	    the	    tasks	    where	    the	    constraints	    haven’t	    been	    removed,	   explanation	   would	   have	   been	   provided,	   and	   they	   will	   be	   put	   back	   in	   the	   pool	   for	   rescheduling.	   • During	    meeting:	    The	    weekly	    work	    plan	    would	    automatically	    be	   populated	    and	    the	    VisiLean	    coordinator	    would	    go	    through	    each	   subcontractor’s	   tasks	   to	   ensure	   that	   all	   the	   parties	   are	   satisfied	   with	   the	   sequence	   and	   are	   committed	   to	   it.	   The	   BIM	   window	   will	   visually	   display	   the	   status	   of	   each	   task,	   and	   hence	   help	   visualise	   the	   sequence	   of	   planned	   tasks.	   Any	   changes	   in	   sequence	   needed	   would	   be	   done	   at	   this	   stage.	   Also,	   task	   priorities	   (if	   not	   set	   al.ready	   at	   the	   Look-­‐ahead	   meeting)	   are	   set	   by	   the	    project	    manager	    or	    collectively	    by	    the	    group.	    These	    priorities	    help	   task	   managers	   select	   the	   tasks	   for	   execution	   during	   the	   week.	   • Post-­‐meeting:	    Each	   stakeholder	   is	   responsible	   to	   execute	   their	   tasks	   in	   order	   of	   set	   priority.	   There	   are	   four	   buttons	   provided	   to	   each	   task,	   start,	   mark	   for	   attention,	   pause/stop	   and	   complete.	   Once	   the	   task	   is	   complete,	   the	    team	    responsible	    for	    starting	    the	    next	    task	    in	    sequence	    gets	    a	   notification.	    	   The	   weekly	   planning	   tab	   is	   where	   tasks	   for	   the	   current	   week	   (the	   executing	   plan)	   or	    the	    coming	    week	    (the	    plan	    in	    preparation)	    are	    listed.	    There	    are	    buttons	   provided	    to	    navigate	    between	    the	    current	    and	    in	    preparation	    plans,	    and	    also	   previous	   plans	   which	   are	   archived	   for	   future	   reference.	   There	   is	   a	   filter	   function	   that	   allows	   users	   to	   show	   only	   certain	   tasks	   and	   sub-­‐tasks	   assigned	   to	   a	   given	   actor	   or	   between	   certain	   dates	   for	   example.	   The	   details	   area	   once	   again	   displays	   detailed	    information	    for	    the	    selected	    item	    (task	    or	    sub-­‐task)	    in	    the	    weekly	   planning	    panel.	    	    The	    actions	    available	    for	    the	    selected	    task	    will	    now	    include	   start,	    mark	    for	    attention,	    stop	    and	    complete,	    and	    pressing	    these	    buttons	    will	   thereby	   update	   the	   task	   status,	   which	   will	   be	   reflected	   in	   the	   BIM	   model	   viewer	   overlay	   for	   the	   item.	   Also,	   if	   the	   item	   is	   not	   completed	   by	   the	   target	   completion	   date,	    the	    option	    to	    define	    a	    reason	    for	    variance	    from	    plan	    becomes	    available.	   Users	   can	   select	   from	   a	   number	   of	   categories	   for	   the	   variance	   and	   provide	   extra	   descriptive	   detail	   as	   to	   the	   exact	   nature	   of	   the	   variance.	   It	   should	   be	   noted	   that	   currently,	   any	   task	   assigned	   to	   the	   weekly	   plan	   must	   have	   a	    duration	    that	    fits	    within	    the	    week	    –	    this	    may	    require	    further	    subdivision	    of	   tasks	   into	   smaller	   units	   to	   meet	   this	   rule	   either	   automatically	   or	   by	   informing	   the	   user	   and	   allowing	   them	   to	   do	   it.	    	   Figure	   38	   shows	   a	   screenshot	   of	   the	   weekly	   planning	   window	   in	   VisiLean	   and	   Table	   25	   describes	   the	   system	   specifications	   and	   the	   release	   schedule.	   	   	   Figure	   38.

Weekly	   Planning	   Specifications	   in	   VisiLean.	   Requirement Specifications Mark the constraint for removal User should be able to mark the pre-requisite for a task as “Available” using a checkbox. Checkbox should be provided in the Resource Prerequisite window at the bottom of the screen. On marking the prerequisite for a task as Available, the task status should change to “Ready” provided there are no other prerequisites for the task. Mark the task as started User should be able to mark the task as started. Once started the colour of the corresponding 3d element changes. Mark task as for attention User should be able to mark the task as being at risk or for attention. Upon invoking this change, a dialog box should popup and user should be able to describe the nature of the impending problem by selecting a pre-defined category of problem and then supplying additional descriptive textual detail. The corresponding 3D element will change colour to reflect the new status Mark the task as stopped For whatever reasons the tasks is stopped, i.e. a resource becomes unavailable etc., the user should be able to stop a task. A dialog box should popup and user should be able to assign a reason from already defined list of reasons and supply additional descriptive text as appropriate. If the task’s previous status was Attention, then some of these details may be copied from those supplied when the initial concern was raised and the Attention status applied. Again, the corresponding 3D element will change colour. Mark the task as Complete User should be able to mark a task as complete. An action button should be provided in the model view. Every task will have representation in the model view. It remains the choice of the user whether or not to create the links to enable this display. There should be an action button in model view, which will be used to mark the status of task as “Complete”. Remove the task from Weekly Plan 1. User should be able to remove the task from the weekly plan. An action button should be provided. On clicking this button, the task will be removed from the weekly plan. The task will be visible in the Lookahead plan as well as phase plan. 2. If the user wishes to remove a task from the weekly plan, system should give user two options. One option is to postpone the task on selection of which system should ask user to input the new start date. If the user selects this option, all the dependent tasks should get postponed by the same amount of time. Second option is to remove the task from project on selection of which, system should remove the task from the project. Model Visualisation (BIM) When a task is selected from the weekly plan, the BIM window should zoom into the corresponding element and highlight the element(s) and also show the status window (showing the status of constraints). 5.5	   Developing	   the	   System	   Architecture	   The	    system	    architecture	    has	    to	    respond	    efficiently	    to	    the	    functional	   requirements	   and	   specifications	   set	   out	   above.	   Also,	   the	   system	   architecture	   has	   to	    provide	    scalability	    for	    additional	    features	    to	    be	    added	    in	    future	    and	    also	   ensure	   that	   they	   are	   well	   supported	   (i.e.	   from	   the	   technological	   perspective).	    	   The	   main	   decision	   that	   had	   to	   be	   made	   was	   to	   select	   the	   type	   of	   application	   the	   new	   system	   should	   be,	   for	   example,	   • A	   desktop	   application,	   which	   runs	   on	   desktop	   computers	   (i.e.	   PC	   or	   Mac).	   • A	   web-­‐based	   system,	   i.e.	   a	   system	   that	   runs	   in	   a	   web	   browser	   • A	    Mobile	    system,	    i.e.	    a	    system	    that	    runs	    on	    mobile	    platforms	    such	    as	   Android,	   iOS,	   etc.	   There	    are	    advantages	    and	    disadvantages	    for	    each	    application	    platform.	    For	   example	   a	   browser	   based	   system	   provides	   the	   most	   flexibility	   as	   it	   can	   operate	   on	   either	   a	   Desktop	   or	   Mobile	   computing	   device,	   whereas	   a	   Desktop	   application	   would	   provide	   the	   users	   familiar	   interface	   and	   will	   integrate	   better	   with	   existing	   desktop	   applications.	   The	   main	   deciding	   factor	   here	   was	   the	   need	   for	   integration	   with	   a	   BIM	   system,	   as	   at	    the	    time	    of	    development,	    none	    of	    the	    leading	    BIM	    system	    had	    a	    web	   component	   that	   could	   provide	   all	   the	   functionalities	   needed.	   Also,	   as	   the	   VisiLean	   system	    needs	    to	    integrate	    with	    the	    BIM	    application	    to	    enable	    linking	    the	   production	   management	   process	   with	   the	   product	   model,	   it	   needs	   access	   to	   the	   programming	   interface,	   known	   as	   the	   API	   (Application	   Programming	   Interface)	   of	    the	    BIM	    application	    platform.	    The	    API	    interfaces	    of	    all	    major	    BIM	    systems	   would	   only	   support	   Desktop	   applications.	   Also,	   viewers	   available	   that	   satisfy	   the	   criteria	    set	    out	    in	    Section	    5.6	    and	    which	    have	    an	    API	    that	    enables	    them	    to	    be	   linked	    to	    the	    production	    management	    system	    are	    only	    available	    as	    Desktop	   applications.	   As	   a	   result	   the	   decision	   was	   taken	   to	   develop	   VisiLean	   as	   a	   Desktop	   application.	   However,	   in	   future	   when	   the	   situation	   is	   more	   favourable	   for	   web	   based	   development,	   the	   VisiLean	   system	   could	   be	   re-­‐designed	   for	   web	   use.	   From	    a	    software	    architecture	    perspective,	    VisiLean	    is	    designed	    as	    a	    client	   desktop	   application	   that	   accesses	   an	   object	   based	   database,	   running	   under	   the	   Microsoft	   .NET	   framework.	   Initially,	   for	   sake	   of	   simplicity	   and	   rapid	   application	   development,	   the	   data	   store	   was	   designed	   to	   be	   located	   on	   the	   same	   computer.	   However,	    it	    is	    planned	    to	    make	    the	    data	    store	    component	    and	    its	    interfaces	   client/server	   capable	   in	   a	   distributed	   environment	   such	   that	   it	   may	   be	   possible	   to	    have	    multiple	    clients	    accessing	    the	    application	    concurrently.	    This	    would	   further	   enable	   different	   client	   applications,	   such	   as	   mobile	   interfaces	   to	   the	   data	   store,	   to	   be	   provided	   for	   different	   end	   user	   groups.	   The	   following	   outlines	   the	   steps	   taken	   in	   developing	   the	   system	   architecture:	   • Selecting	   the	   technological	   platforms	   • Defining	   top	   level	   concept/system	   architecture	   • Developing	   the	   object	   model	   • Developing	   the	   database	   and	   communication	   specifications	   • Defining	   the	   business	   layer	   (objects,	   properties	   and	   processes)	   • Designing	   the	   user	   interface	   layer	   • Designing	   reports	   5.5.1	   Selecting	   the	   Technological	   Platform	   One	    of	    the	    initial	    steps	    in	    software	    development	    process	    is	    selection	    of	   technological	   platform(s)	   the	   solution	   will	   be	   based	   on.	   It	   is	   important	   to	   select	   a	   platform	    that	    will	    be	    most	    suitable	    in	    terms	    of	    programming	    features,	   interoperability,	    scalability	    and	    ease	    of	    development.	    Table	    26	    shows	    the	   selected	    technologies	    for	    development	    of	    VisiLean,	    and	    the	    discussion	    below	   outlines	   the	   factors	   for	   their	   selection.	    	   Table	   26.

As	   the	   VisiLean	   system	   greatly	   depends	   on	   the	   integration	   with	   BIM	   system(s),	   the	   choice	   of	   the	   development	    platform	    also	    depended	    on	    the	    API	    (Application	    Programming	   Interface)	   availability	   in	   the	   BIM	   system.	   As	   Navisworks	   was	   chosen	   as	   the	   BIM	   platform,	   and	   as	   the	   Navisworks	   API	   was	   available	   on	   the	   .Net	   platform,	   .Net	   was	   selected	   as	   the	   overall	   technology	   platform.	   5.5.1.2	   OS	   Platform	   Apart	    from	    Graphisoft,	    which	    has	    been	    available	    on	    both	    Mac	    and	    Windows	   platforms,	   all	   major	   BIM	   applications	   are	   only	   available	   as	   Windows	   applications	   (except	   the	   new	   Revit	   Architecture	   application	   which	   wasn’t	   yet	   available	   when	   the	    research	    started).	    This	    made	    Microsoft™	    Windows	    as	    the	    main	    choice	    of	   Operation	   System	   for	   development.	    	   5.5.1.3	   Database	   The	   database	   chosen	   in	   the	   first	   instance	   was	   Versant	   Technologies'	   db4o	   (or	   DB	   for	   objects),	   which	   as	   its	   name	   suggests	   is	   a	   native	   Java	   or	   .Net	   object	   storage	   medium.	   The	   database	   comes	   with	   sophisticated	   query	   mechanisms	   to	   retrieve	   objects	    as	    required	    in	    response	    to	    varied	    criteria.	    This	    database	    was	    chosen	   initially	   over	   the	   many	   relational	   and	   document	   based	   alternatives	   primarily	   as	   it	   offers	    the	    simplest	    means	    to	    store	    and	    retrieve	    an	    object	    graph	    according	    to	   arbitrarily	   complex	   criteria	   with	   the	   least	   effort	   in	   development	   terms.	   Relational	   databases,	   though	   efficient	   and	   undoubtedly	   more	   scalable	   than	   db4o,	   require	   a	   significant	   amount	   of	   work	   in	   terms	   of	   so	   called	   object-­‐relational-­‐mapping.	   This	   is	    the	    process	    of	    somehow	    defining	    a	    mapping	    between	    the	    two	    different	   schemata	    of	    object	    models	    and	    entity	    relations	    used	    by	    object-­‐orientated	   systems	   and	   relational	   databases	   respectively.	    	   5.5.1.4	   Programming	   Language	   While	   most	   of	   the	   available	   BIM	   applications	   that	   expose	   at	   least	   one	   API	   do	   so	   in	   C/C++,	   the	   chosen	   BIM	   platform	   (Navisworks)	   also	   exposes	   a	   .Net	   API	   which	   is	   significantly	    easier	    to	    develop	    against.	    Other	    advantages	    of	    the	    .Net	    runtime	   include	   automated	   garbage	   collection,	   a	   wide	   variety	   of	   component	   libraries	   for	   performing	    various	    tasks	    and,	    in	    Windows	    Presentation	    Foundation	    (WPF),	    a	   rich	   user	   interface	   framework	   which	   is	   natively	   touch	   aware	   and	   built	   from	   the	   ground	   up	   for	   the	   Windows	   operating	   system,	   our	   OS	   platform	   of	   choice.	   Given	   that	    the	    developer's	    previous	    experience	    included	    significant	    amounts	    of	    Java	   development,	   C#	   was	   the	   chosen	   .Net	   language	   for	   VisiLean	   development	   as	   it	   imposed	   the	   least	   overhead	   in	   terms	   of	   the	   transition	   to	   a	   new	   language,	   it	   being	   in	   many	   ways	   very	   similar	   to	   Java.	   Further	   it	   was	   believed	   that	   object	   orientated	   (OO)	   development	   was	   the	   most	   natural	   fit	   for	   modelling	   the	   domain	   of	   business	   objects	    required	    for	    VisiLean's	    operation,	    and	    C#	    is	    designed	    with	    OO	   design/development	   as	   its	   primary	   paradigm.	   5.5.1.5	   Development	   Tools	   Microsoft's	    Visual	    Studio	    (VS)	    was	    chosen	    as	    the	    main	    development	    tool	    for	   VisiLean	    as	    it	    is	    seemed	    the	    most	    natural,	    and	    complete,	    development	   environment	   available	   for	   .Net.	   Initially	   development	   was	   carried	   out	   using	   VS	   2008,	   but	   was	   later	   transitioned	   to	   VS	   2010	   as	   it	   was	   thought	   that	   it	   would	   be	   possible	   then	   to	   take	   advantage	   of	   new	   developments	   in	   the	   .Net	   4.0	   runtime.	   As	   it	    transpired,	    there	    were	    some	    versioning	    issues	    with	    Navisworks,	    which	   prevented	   it	   from	   exploiting	   the	   newer	   runtime	   and	   its	   features	   and	   as	   such	   the	   development	   reverted	   to	   .Net	   3.5.	    	   Alongside	    Visual	    Studio,	    the	    developer	    used	    Microsoft	    Expression	    Studio,	    in	   particular	    Expression	    Blend,	    in	    designing	    and	    building	    the	    user	    interface	   elements	   of	   the	   application.	   Once	   again,	   this	   tool	   from	   Microsoft	   was	   the	   most	   complete	   of	   its	   kind	   for	   the	   development	   of	   WPF	   based	   user	   interfaces	   and	   eased	   the	    development	    cycle	    thereof	    considerably	    by	    presenting	    accurately	    the	   appearance	   of	   the	   user	   interface	   at	   design	   time.	   Other	   tools	   employed	   in	   the	   development	   lifecycle	   included	   Subversion,	   a	   source	   code	    versioning	    and	    management	    application.	    Subversion	    is	    a	    client	    server	   application	   designed	   to	   let	   teams	   manage	   the	   evolution	   and	   versioning	   of	   a	   code	   base.	    During	    the	    development	    of	    VisiLean,	    subversion	    served	    primarily	    in	    its	   versioning	    role	    allowing	    us	    to	    branch	    development	    and	    try	    out	    different	   approaches	    to	    solving	    problems,	    leaving	    fallow	    those	    branches	    which	    proved	   inadequate	    and	    re-­‐integrating	    to	    the	    main,	    or	    trunk,	    branch	    those	    which	    were	   deemed	   suitable	   for	   inclusion	   in	   the	   final	   deliverable.	   5.5.1.7	   External	   Systems	   For	   the	   development	   of	   integration	   code	   linking	   VisiLean	   to	   other	   applications,	   it	   was	   required	   to	   install	   and	   run	   a	   number	   of	   different	   pieces	   of	   software	   such	   as	   Oracle	    Primavera	    P6,	    Microsoft	    Project	    and	    Microsoft	    Excel.	    In	    attempting	    to	   integrate	    some	    of	    these	    systems,	    it	    was	    required	    to	    develop	    code	    to	    leverage	   their	    APIs	    for	    data	    import	    into	    VisiLean.	    It	    is	    envisaged	    that	    in	    time	    the	    data	   imported	   would	   include	   task	   data,	   resource	   data,	   external	   production	   schedule	   and	    shipping	    data,	    personnel	    data	    etc.	    At	    present,	    only	    task	    data	    is	    imported	   however	    due	    to	    the	    lack	    of	    resource	    to	    complete	    more	    integration	    code.	    The	   primary	   integration	   completed	   so	   far	   is	   that	   which	   takes	   a	   Primavera	   exported	   Excel	    spreadsheet	    and	    automates	    the	    Excel	    application	    through	    Microsoft's	   Office	   interop	   (interoperability)	   assemblies	   to	   read	   the	   task	   information	   therein	   into	   VisiLean.	   5.5.1.8	   Reporting	   One	   of	   the	   down	   sides	   of	   the	   chosen	   database	   for	   VisiLean's	   first	   development	   iterations	   is	   that	   the	   majority	   of	   reporting	   frameworks	   expect	   to	   be	   used	   with	   a	   relational	   data	   source	   (as	   opposed	   to	   object	   oriented).	   As	   such	   steps	   have	   been	   taken	   for	   building	   reports	   into	   VisiLean	   using	   the	   components	   available	   in	   WPF	   itself.	   This	   will	   relieve	   VisiLean	   of	   any	   dependency	   on	   a	   third	   party	   library	   for	   this	    important	    area	    of	    functionality.	    An	    open	    source	    project	    called	    the	    WPF	   Toolkit	   is	   available	   which	   comes	   with	   some	   basic	   chart	   controls	   that	   have	   been	   employed	   in	   VisiLean's	   reporting	   features.	   5.5.2	   Defining	   Top	   Level	   System	   Architecture	   During	   the	   initial	   stages	   of	   software	   conceptualisation,	   the	   academic	   literature	   in	   the	   domain	   of	   lean	   construction	   management	   was	   reviewed,	   particularly	   the	   Last	   Planner	    System™(Ballard,	    2000).	    From	    these	    readings	    a	    conceptual	    domain	   model	   for	   lean	   construction	   management	   was	   developed,	   which	   helped	   identify	   the	    primary	    functional	    areas	    that	    would	    be	    required	    of	    a	    software	    system	    to	   support	    the	    process.	    Once	    these	    areas	    were	    identified,	    initial	    design	    of	    the	   supporting	   functions	   of	   a	   typical	   software	   system	   was	   carried	   out,	   such	   as	   data	   storage,	   communications	   and	   user	   interface	   requirements.	   There	   are	   elements	   of	   the	    process	    model	    that	    map	    into	    parts	    of	    these	    support	    functions,	    and	    which	   begin	   to	   determine	   the	   shape	   of	   the	   final	   software	   in	   terms	   of	   its	   architecture	   and	   operation.	    For	    example,	    the	    user	    interface	    must	    embody	    the	    process	    of	    lean	   construction	    management,	    which	    is	    embedded	    into	    business	    logic	    in	    the	   application,	    whilst	    simultaneously	    remaining	    decoupled	    from	    the	    logic	    and	   process	   to	   the	   greatest	   possible	   degree	   in	   technical	   terms.	   This	   is	   to	   maintain	   the	   boundaries	    of	    functional	    components	    within	    the	    system	    and	    to	    aid	    in	    making	   various	   parts	   of	   the	   application	   usable	   in	   more	   than	   one	   context,	   such	   as	   native	   mobile	    applications	    accessing	    the	    business	    logic	    interfaces	    without	    requiring	   reference	   to	   the	   desktop	   UI	   components	   for	   the	   whole	   to	   function	   correctly.	   The	    architecture	    that	    was	    finally	    adopted	    incorporated	    a	    multi-­‐tier	    approach	   having	   the	   database	   with	   a	   data	   access	   interface	   at	   its	   bottom	   level,	   followed	   by	   business	   logic	   modules	   accessed	   through	   service	   interfaces	   by	   a	   UI	   tier	   at	   the	   top	   level	    as	    shown	    in	    Figure	    39.	    Also	    feeding	    into	    this	    architecture	    are	    external	   systems,	    for	    which	    separate	    modules	    exist	    to	    manage	    the	    communication.	    For	   example	   the	   import	   of	   scheduling	   data	   from	   Oracle’s	   Primavera	   is	   handled	   this	   way.	   Further,	   as	   the	   core	   of	   the	   system	   does	   not	   handle	   the	   geometric	   data	   of	   BIM	   models,	   another	   external	   system	   in	   the	   shape	   of	   Autodesk’s	   Navisworks	   was	   selected	   to	   manage	   that	   aspect.	   This	   is	   integrated	   at	   the	   UI	   level	   for	   end	   users	   to	   interact	   with.	   Again	   there	   is	   a	   dedicated	   module	   to	   handle	   interaction	   with	   this	   system	   through	   interface	   definitions	   of	   the	   operations	   that	   are	   to	   be	   realised	   on	   the	   BIM	   model	   itself.	   Another,	    as	    yet	    unimplemented,	    part	    of	    the	    system	    is	    the	    interface	    to	    other	   business	    systems	    such	    as	    component	    manufacturer’s	    production	    management	   systems.	    These	    modules	    would	    be	    designed	    to	    bring	    in	    data	    about	    production	   and	   delivery	   schedules	   for	   the	   materials	   and	   components	   required	   to	   execute	   the	   tasks	    in	    the	    project	    plan,	    such	    as	    delivery	    date	    etc.	    From	    an	    architectural	   standpoint,	    they	    would	    be	    plug-­‐in	    modules	    that	    could	    be	    deployed	    into	    the	   application	   as	   and	   when	   required	   to	   interact	   with	   other	   systems.	   It	   is	   envisaged	   that	   this	   interaction	   would	   take	   place	   over	   Web	   Services	   protocols	   such	   as	   SOAP	   or	   REST	   (Representational	   State	   Transfer)-­‐based	   services.	   It	    is	    further	    envisaged	    that	    the	    VisiLean	    application	    will	    eventually	    be	    a	   distributed	   application	   in	   nature	   and	   cater	   for	   multiple	   simultaneous	   users.	   This	   distribution	    of	    application	    components	    is	    reflected	    in	    the	    future	    architecture	   diagram	   (Figure	   39),	   wherein	   the	   application	   layers	   defined	   above	   are	   separated	   onto	    different	    physical	    machines	    for	    scalability	    and	    accessibility.	    A	    higher	   resolution	   version	   of	   Figure	   39	   is	   provided	   in	   Appendix	   C.	   	   Figure	   39.	   Top	   Level	   System	   Architecture	   for	   VisiLean.	   5.5.2.1	   Designing	   Main	   Application	   Modules	   The	    main	    application	    modules	    within	    the	    VisiLean	    application	    were	    identified	   next	    by	    further	    decomposing	    and	    describing	    the	    domain	    model	    and	    primary	   functional	    modules.	    The	    modules	    below	    were	    identified	    and	    implemented	    as	   Visual	   Studio	   projects	   in	   the	   C#	   language.	   Having	   each	   module	   implemented	   as	   separate	   project	   aids	   in	   the	   effort	   to	   maintain	   code	   libraries	   that	   are	   decoupled	   from	   each	   other	   and	   which	   could	   reasonably	   be	   reused	   in	   a	   different	   version	   of	   the	   system	   independent	   of	   some	   of	   the	   other	   modules.	   Each	   project	   compiles	   to	   its	   own	   Dynamic	   Link	   Library	   (DLL),	   which	   is	   an	   application	   sub-­‐part	   loaded	   into	   the	   main	   application	   as	   required	   at	   run-­‐time.	   The	   only	   Visual	   Studio	   project	   that	   does	   not	   emit	   a	   DLL	   is	   LastPlannerGUI,	   which	   compiles	   to	   an	   executable	   (EXE),	   with	    which	    many	    end	    users	    will	    be	    familiar	    from	    their	    use	    of	    other	    computer	   applications	   for	   other	   tasks.	   The	   following	   describes	   the	   Visual	   Studio	   projects	   that	   comprise	   VisiLean.	   • LastPlannerLib	    –	    This	    is	    the	    core	    module	    of	    VisiLean	    having	    the	    business	   objects	    and	    logic,	    the	    data	    access	    interface	    definition	    and	    the	    ‘services’	   (business	   methods)	   used	   to	   manipulate	   the	   business	   objects.	   • VisileanBimLink	    –	    This	    is	    a	    set	    of	    interface	    definitions	    that	    describe	    the	   means	    by	    which	    BIM	    objects	    are	    referenced	    from	    VisiLean	    and	    BIM	   applications	   are	   controlled	   in	   terms	   of	   showing/hiding	   elements,	   views	   etc.	   This	    module	    was	    created	    as	    initially	    the	    thought	    was	    to	    maintain	    a	    BIM	   application	    agnostic	    stance	    whereby	    any	    BIM	    application	    having	    an	   accessible	    API	    could	    be	    potentially	    linked	    to	    VisiLean.	    The	    decision	    to	    use	   Navisworks	   as	   the	   first	   demonstrator	   was	   made	   as	   it	   offers	   an	   embeddable	   control	    that	    would	    appear	    to	    be	    part	    of	    VisiLean.	    Other	    BIM	    applications	   would	    essentially	    need	    to	    be	    automated	    in	    a	    ‘side-­‐by-­‐side’	    configuration	   where	    the	    BIM	    model	    is	    presented	    in	    its	    own	    application	    window.	    This	   module	    also	    contains	    the	    interface	    definition	    for	    a	    data	    access	    component	   that	    stores	    and	    retrieves	    data	    about	    the	    links	    between	    the	    main	    VisiLean	   application	   and	   BIM	   models.	   Thus	   the	   databases	   for	   the	   main	   application	   and	   links	   to	   BIM	   models	   are	   in	   fact	   separate	   entities.	   • LastPlannerDb	   –	   This	   is	   an	   implementation	   of	   the	   two	   data	   access	   interfaces	   mentioned	   above,	   for	   the	   db4o	   database.	   There	   is	   also	   a	   part	   implemented	   version	    for	    relational	    databases	    accessed	    through	    the	    NHibernate	   framework,	   though	   this	   is	   incomplete	   and	   is	   not	   being	   actively	   developed	   at	   present.	   • VisileanExcelAutomation	    –	    This	    module	    implements	    the	    import	    of	   Primavera	    V6.0	    data	    via	    Microsoft	    Excel	    into	    VisiLean.	    This	    is	    a	    two	    stage	   process	   whereby	   the	   data	   must	   be	   exported	   from	   Primavera	   into	   an	   MS	   Excel	   file,	   which	   is	   then	   parsed	   and	   the	   data	   imported	   into	   VisiLean.	   Currently	   this	   is	   a	   one-­‐way	   process	   with	   no	   updates	   being	   sent	   back	   to	   Primavera.	   • NavisworksWPFControl	   –	   This	   is	   an	   implementation	   of	   a	   WPF	   UserControl,	   which	   embeds	   the	   Navisworks	   .NET	   Winforms	   control	   and	   implements	   the	   interfaces	    defined	    in	    the	    VisileanBimLink	    module	    to	    provide	    BIM	    model	   display	   and	   manipulation	   to	   VisiLean.	   • TreeListView	    –	    This	    is	    an	    extension	    of	    the	    WPF	    TreeView	    control,	    which	   combines	   the	   tree	   view	   and	   list	   view	   to	   provide	   an	   expandable	   hierarchical	   grid,	   which	   is	   employed	   in	   the	   UI	   in	   the	   Phase	   Planning	   tab.	   • LastPlannerGUI	   –	   This	   is	   the	   module,	   which	   implements	   the	   VisiLean	   UI	   in	   WPF	    and	    forms	    the	    main	    executable	    for	    the	    application.	    As	    such	    it	    has	   dependencies	   on	   all	   the	   other	   modules	   mentioned	   above.	   It	   also	   manages	   the	   creation	    and	    display	    of	    BIM	    popup	    windows	    for	    the	    embedded	    BIM	    model	   configuration	    (Where	    the	    BIM	    model	    is	    presented	    in	    ‘side-­‐by-­‐side’	   configuration,	    the	    popups	    are	    generated	    by	    the	    BIM	    application	    itself	    and	   managed	   through	   the	   VisileanBimLink	   interfaces).	   5.5.2.1	   The	   object	   model	   Finally,	    having	    identified	    the	    major	    functional	    components	    of	    the	    VisiLean	   system,	   and	   their	   representation	   as	   software	   modules,	   the	   design	   of	   the	   actual	   object	    model	    for	    the	    system	    was	    initiated.	    This	    entailed	    the	    further	    breaking	   down	   of	   the	   descriptions	   for	   the	   modules	   to	   determine	   precisely	   by	   noun-­‐verb	   analysis,	    the	    required	    objects	    and	    the	    interactions	    between	    them.	    In	    the	    first	   instance	    this	    mainly	    involved	    the	    design	    of	    the	    business	    logic	    classes	    such	    as	   Project,	   Phase,	   Task,	   Sub-­‐Task	   and	   Resource	   and	   the	   service	   interfaces	   through	   which	   they	   would	   be	   manipulated.	   As	   the	   names	   of	   the	   classes	   noted	   above	   may	   suggest,	   the	   object	   model	   initially	   had	   only	   three	   levels	   of	   hierarchy	   for	   project	   activities,	   Phase,	   Task	   and	   Sub-­‐Task.	   These	   three	   classes	   were	   later	   superseded	   by	   the	   Activity	   class,	   which	   could	   be	   arbitrarily	   nested	   to	   any	   level	   of	   hierarchical	   depth.	    The	    primary	    class	    to	    represent	    project	    resources	    is	    the	    IResource	   interface,	   which	   has	   a	   number	   of	   concrete	   implementations	   including	   Material,	   Component,	    Actor,	    Space,	    Plan	    and	    Information.	    All	    of	    these	    resources	    can	    be	   further	   categorised	   by	   the	   assignment	   of	   a	   Category	   to	   the	   resource.	   Again,	   in	   the	   initial	   object	   model,	   there	   was	   only	   one	   category	   assignment	   per	   resource,	   but	   this	    changed	    over	    time	    such	    that	    it	    is	    now	    possible	    to	    categorise	    a	    resource	   under	    several	    different	    categories.	    The	    ICategory	    interface	    is	    the	    basis	    of	    the	   categorisation	    sub-­‐system	    and	    like	    IResource	    has	    a	    number	    of	    sub-­‐classes	   associated	    with	    particular	    types	    of	    resource.	    For	    example,	    the	    Actor	    class	    will	   have	   a	   Role	   associated	   with	   it,	   the	   Role	   being	   a	   specialisation	   of	   the	   ICategory	   interface	    for	    Actor	    instances.	    The	    MaterialCategory	    class	    features	    a	    number	    of	   properties	   common	   to	   consumable	   resources	   such	   as	   materials	   and	   components,	   and	   indeed	   is	   applied	   to	   resources	   of	   type	   Material	   and	   Component.	   These,	   along	   with	   classes	   representing	   both	   Look-­‐ahead	   and	   Weekly	   plans	   form	   the	   primary	   business	    process	    logic	    classes	    of	    the	    VisiLean	    system.	    Other	    classes,	    though	   numerous,	   play	   a	   supporting	   role	   in	   the	   system	   such	   as	   defining	   UI	   behaviour	   or	   accessing	   the	   database	   to	   retrieve	   objects.	   Figure	   40	   below	   shows	   a	   section	   of	   one	   of	   the	   class	   diagrams	   developed	   for	   the	   VisiLean	   system.	   On	   it	   can	   be	   seen	   some	    of	    the	    classes	    mentioned	    above	    along	    with	    a	    number	    of	    implementation	   specific	   classes	   such	   as	   PlanBase	   and	   TaskBase.	   These	   implementation	   specific	   classes	   exist	   to	   collect	   common	   functionality	   into	   a	   single	   place	   thereby	   reducing	   duplication	   and	   making	   the	   propagation	   of	   updates	   across	   all	   affected	   classes	   a	   matter	   of	   edits	   to	   one	   file	   rather	   than	   four	   or	   five.	   This	   centralising	   of	   common	   functionality	   is	   known	   as	   inheritance	   and	   is	   one	   of	   the	   major	   tenets	   of	   the	   object	   orientated	    software	    design	    paradigm	    that	    was	    followed	    in	    the	    development	    of	   VisiLean.	   	   Figure	   40.	   Example	   of	   VisiLean	   Object	   Model.	   5.6	   The	   iterations	   of	   VisiLean	   This	    section	    describes	    the	    development	    process	    for	    VisiLean	    in	    three	    major	   iterations.	    As	    such,	    the	    Scrum	    method	    of	    development	    was	    followed,	    and	    as	    a	   result	   VisiLean	   went	   through	   daily	   iterations.	   However,	   for	   sake	   of	   clarity,	   the	   development	    has	    been	    conceptualised	    in	    three	    major	    iterations.	    The	    overall	   range	   of	   features	   available	   in	   VisiLean	   are	   listed	   in	   the	   functional	   requirements	   document,	   here	   the	   discussion	   is	   regarding	   the	   process	   of	   development	   and	   the	   reasons	   why	   these	   features	   were	   implemented	   in	   the	   particular	   sequence.	   Each	   section	    describes	    the	    features	    of	    VisiLean	    accompanied	    by	    screenshots	    of	    the	   prototype.	   Due	   to	   relatively	   limited	   space	   available	   in	   the	   thesis	   page	   layout,	   high	   resolution	   images	   are	   provided	   in	   Appendix	   C.	   Table	   27	   below	   shows	   the	   main	   evaluation	   goals	   of	   each	   iteration.	    	   Table	   27.	   Main	   VisiLean	   Iterations.	   Iteration Duration Main Evaluations 1 2 months Basic interface evaluation, Top level process, Top level model functionality 2 6 months Refining interface features, resource management evaluation, deciding task hierarchies, detailed process evaluation 3 10 months Main user interface, detailed user interface (buttons, layout, item selection), communication, resource management, constraints management, Model interaction 5.6.1	   Iteration	   1	   The	   main	   goals	   of	   the	   very	   first	   iteration	   were	   to	   validate	   the	   main	   user	   interface	   design,	   and	   then	   decide	   the	   top	   level	   planning	   process	   and	   model	   functionality.	   This	   was	   a	   very	   quick	   iteration	   as	   it	   did	   not	   focus	   in	   detail	   on	   feature	   selection	   of	   either	   the	   planning	   or	   model	   integration	   processes,	   but	   on	   validation	   of	   the	   top-­level	   goals	   of	   the	   process.	   5.6.1.1	   User	   Interface	    	   The	   main	   decision	   regarding	   User	   Interface	   at	   this	   stage	   was	   about	   placement	   of	   planning	    and	    model	    window,	    overall	    button	    layout,	    interface	    layout	    and	    the	   general	   look	   and	   feel	   of	   the	   interface.	   	   Figure	   41.	   Tabbed	   User	   Interface	   in	   VisiLean.	   The	    first	    shell	    of	    the	    application	    had	    a	    rigid	    frame	    between	    the	    planning	    and	   model	   window	   that	   didn’t	   allow	   resizing	   the	   model	   or	   planning	   window	   if	   there	   was	   a	   need	   to	   do	   so.	   After	   evaluation,	   a	   decision	   was	   taken	   to	   make	   the	   frames	   flexible	   so	   either	   window	   could	   be	   resized	   to	   adjust	   to	   the	   model	   view	   to	   enable	   proper	   visualisation.	    	   It	    was	    also	    decided	    to	    have	    a	    tabbed	    interface	    that	    allowed	    quick	    switching	   between	    each	    planning	    functions,	    which	    is	    shown	    in	    Figure	    41.	    Also,	    it	    was	   decided	   that	   constraints	   analysis	   would	   be	   carried	   out	   using	   checkboxes,	   i.e.	   each	   constraint	   will	   have	   a	   checkbox	   next	   to	   it,	   clicking	   it	   would	   make	   that	   particular	   constraint	   available	   in	   the	   system.	   5.6.1.2	   Planning	   Process	   At	   this	   stage,	   the	   actual	   planning	   process	   had	   not	   been	   implemented,	   however,	   decisions	    regarding	    the	    top-­‐level	    workflow	    were	    taken	    which	    led	    to	    its	   implementation	   in	   the	   second	   iteration.	   In	   the	   first	   iteration,	   the	   planning	   process	   would	   support	   a	   three	   level	   activity	   hierarchy	   structure,	   namely	   phase,	   task	   and	   sub-­‐tasks.	   It	   would	   be	   possible	   to	   have	   finish-­‐start	   relationship	   between	   these	   activities.	   It	   was	   decided	   that	   each	   activity	   (i.e.	   phase,	   task	   or	   sub-­‐task)	   would	   have	   an	   actor	   assigned	   to	   it.	   The	   actor	   could	    be	    an	    organisation,	    a	    team	    or	    an	    individual.	    This	    actor	    will	    also	    be	   responsible	   to	   manage	   the	   constraints	   within	   the	   planning	   process,	   and	   also	   to	   manage	   the	   task	   during	   execution.	   5.6.1.3	   Product	   Navigation	   (BIM	   window)	   The	   main	   decision	   regarding	   the	   model	   integration	   was	   regarding	   the	   selection	   BIM	   application,	   which	   would	   satisfy	   the	   functional	   requirements	   and	   also	   have	   an	    API	    (Application	    Programming	    Interface),	    which	    would	    let	    the	    model	    be	   integrated	    with	    the	    VisiLean	    application.	    Once	    Autodesk	    Navisworks™	    was	   selected	    as	    the	    main	    platform,	    the	    decision	    regarding	    the	    navigational	   functionality	    was	    made,	    and	    Panning,	    Selecting,	    Zooming	    and	    Rotating	    were	   chosen	   as	   the	   main	   navigation	   functions.	   5.6.2	   Iteration	   2	   A	    range	    of	    feedback	    capturing	    methods	    were	    used	    between	    iteration	    1	    and	   iteration	   2	   and	   also	   during	   the	   development	   of	   2nd	   iteration,	   which	   contributed	   to	   the	   development	   of	   features	   selected	   in	   2nd	   iteration.	   The	   second	   iteration	   was	   the	    most	    intense	    part	    of	    the	    functional	    development	    where	    most	    features	    of	   VisiLean	   were	   defined	   and	   implemented.	    	   5.6.2.1	   Refining	   the	   interface	   The	    first	    iteration	    had	    simple	    buttons,	    which	    were	    small	    and	    made	    it	    hard	    to	   identify	   what	   their	   purpose	   was.	   In	   the	   second	   iteration,	   new	   graphical	   buttons	   were	    introduced	    which	    provided	    visual	    feedback	    to	    the	    user	    and	    made	    the	   selection	   more	   intuitive.	   The	   main	   process-­‐product	   integration	   and	   visualisation	   was	   implemented	   during	   this	   iteration.	   Here,	   a	   process	   status	   symbol	   was	   designed	   that	   would	   be	   overlaid	   on	   top	   of	   the	   connected	   BIM	   element	   when	   a	   respective	   task	   was	   selected	   in	   the	   planning	    window.	    This	    graphical	    status	    symbol	    would	    have	    the	    following	   information:	   • Name	   of	   the	   task	   • Person/team/organisation	   responsible	   • Constraints	   and	   their	   status	   • Priority	    	   Overall,	   the	   colour	   of	   the	   status	   box	   would	   match	   the	   status	   colour	   of	   the	   task	   according	   to	   the	   colour	   coding	   explained	   in	   5.3.1.1.	   5.6.2.2	   Task	   hierarchy	    	   One	    of	    the	    core	    functions	    of	    the	    VisiLean	    application	    is	    planning	    and	    hence	   designing	    the	    task	    management	    functions	    in	    an	    effective	    way	    was	    very	   important.	    Following	    several	    demonstrations	    to	    focus	    user	    groups	    during	    and	   after	    1st	    iteration,	    feedback	    from	    potential	    users	    regarding	    task	    hierarchy	    was	   that	    the	    application	    should	    not	    restrict	    the	    users	    to	    a	    three	    level	    activity	   hierarchy.	   As	   the	   planning	   process	   starts	   to	   get	   detailed,	   especially	   during	   look-­ahead	    and	    weekly	    planning	    sessions,	    there	    may	    be	    instances	    where	    the	    tasks	   have	   to	   be	   decomposed	   into	   deeper	   levels.	   Hence,	   it	   was	   decided	   that	   the	   users	   would	   be	   able	   to	   break	   an	   activity	   down	   to	   their	   desired	   level	   and	   will	   not	   be	   restricted	    to	    a	    three	    level	    hierarchical	    structure.	    However,	    it	    should	    be	    noted	   here	   that	   this	   would	   also	   have	   to	   be	   matched	   in	   the	   BIM	   model	   elements,	   and	   the	   model	   should	   be	   detailed	   enough	   to	   support	   the	   level	   of	   detail	   the	   tasks	   are	   being	   planned	   at.	   A	   number	   of	   decisions	   regarding	   task	   sequencing	   and	   decision	   making	   process	   if	   a	   task	   gets	   delayed	   were	   also	   taken	   during	   the	   2nd	   iteration.	   The	   key	   decision	   in	   this	   respect	   was	   regarding	   the	   sequencing	   and	   changes	   in	   the	   dates/duration	   of	   connected	   tasks	   and	   the	   overall	   project	   (if	   the	   changes	   are	   deep)	   if	   a	   task	   gets	   delayed.	   It	   was	   debated	   whether	   to	   automatically	   update	   the	   dates	   of	   subsequent	   tasks	    and	    the	    parent	    phase	    (or	    task)	    if	    a	    task	    or	    subtask	    gets	    delayed	    or	   rescheduled,	    or	    should	    the	    decision	    be	    left	    to	    the	    user	    and	    provide	    the	   information	   to	   the	   user	   about	   this	   potential	   delay.	   It	   was	   decided	   that	   it	   is	   best	   to	   leave	   the	   decision	   to	   the	   user	   whether	   he/she	   wants	   to	   keep	   the	   parent	   phase	   or	   task	    dates	    unchanged	    and	    will	    mitigate	    the	    situation	    through	    resource	   management	   or	   whether	   the	   system	   should	   calculate	   the	   delay	   and	   appropriately	   change	    the	    parent	    phase/task	    dates	    and	    if	    needed	    cascade	    the	    change	    (if	    the	   parent	    phase/task	    is	    connected	    with	    other	    phase/tasks	    and	    subsequently	    the	   project	   end	   date).	   This	   particular	   issue	   also	   directed	   the	   focus	   towards	   another	   aspect	   related	   to	   the	   critical	   path	   of	   the	   project,	   i.e.	   if	   a	   phase	   or	   task	   falls	   within	   the	   critical	   path	   of	   the	   project	   and	   has	   a	   potential	   to	   affect	   the	   duration	   of	   the	   project.	   Hence,	   a	   new	   feature	   was	   implemented	   called	   “show	   dependents”,	   which	   will	   be	   made	   available	   to	   each	   task.	   Upon	   pressing	   this	   button,	   the	   system	   will	   graphically	    display	    all	    the	    connected	    tasks/phases	    with	    the	    selected	    tasks	    (i.e.	   the	   position	   of	   the	   selected	   task	   with	   respect	   to	   the	   critical	   path	   of	   the	   project).	    	   5.6.2.3	   Organisational	   hierarchy	   In	   the	   first	   iteration,	   the	   organisational	   hierarchy	   was	   only	   down	   to	   two	   levels,	   Organisations	    and	    Individuals	    (which	    belong	    to	    that	    organisation).	    In	    VisiLean	   each	    task	    is	    assigned	    to	    an	    actor	    (i.e.	    the	    entity	    responsible	    for	    executing	    the	   task).	    During	    the	    discussions	    with	    user,	    it	    emerged,	    that	    as	    many	    tasks	    are	   performed	   by	   a	   pre-­‐defined	   group	   of	   individuals,	   i.e.	   teams,	   provision	   to	   group	   such	   individuals	   should	   also	   be	   provided	   in	   the	   VisiLean	   system.	   Hence,	   in	   the	   second	    iteration	    of	    the	    software,	    an	    additional	    entity	    was	    added	    to	    the	   organisational	   hierarchy.	    	   5.6.2.4	   Resource	   management	   Resource	   management	   and	   constraints	   analysis	   and	   management	   are	   two	   most	   important	    aspects	    in	    production	    management,	    hence	    in	    VisiLean.	    These	    two	   aspects	    are	    related	    to	    flow	    or	    “F”	    view	    of	    production	    and	    help	    keep	    the	   production	    running	    efficiently	    and	    reduce	    variability.	    In	    the	    first	    iteration	    of	   VisiLean,	   there	   was	   “one	   to	   one”	   mapping	   between	   a	   task	   and	   a	   resource,	   where	   each	   individual	   resource	   had	   to	   be	   created	   separately	   within	   the	   system.	   Also,	   in	   the	    first	    iteration,	    the	    VisiLean	    system	    did	    not	    distinguish	    between	    the	   consumable	    (for	    example	    cement,	    steel,	    paint	    etc.)	    and	    non-­‐consumable	   resources	    (i.e.	    equipment,	    manpower,	    space	    etc.).	    This	    short-­‐coming	    was	   identified	    during	    the	    discussions	    and	    feedback	    while	    demonstrating	    the	    1st	   iteration	    of	    the	    software.	    In	    the	    2nd	    iteration	    of	    the	    software	    it	    was	    made	    it	   possible	   to	   distinguish	   between	   consumable	   and	   non-­‐consumable	   resources	   and	   also	   the	   notion	   of	   total	   quantity	   available	   for	   any	   given	   resource	   was	   introduced.	   For	   example,	   there	   could	   be	   500	   bags	   of	   a	   particular	   grade	   of	   cement	   available	   (delivered)	   on	   site	   out	   of	   which	   475	   could	   be	   allocated	   between	   three	   tasks	   (the	   system	   would	   calculate	   this	   total	   automatically)	   and	   inform	   the	   user	   that	   25	   bags	   remain.	   If	   the	   user	   tries	   to	   allocate	   100	   bags	   to	   a	   task	   in	   the	   look-­‐ahead	   plan,	   the	   VisiLean	    system	    will	    allow	    the	    user	    to	    release	    this	    constraint	    before	    25	   additional	   bags	   would	   be	   delivered	   to	   the	   site.	   5.6.3	   Iteration	   3	   The	   3rd	   iteration	   was	   mainly	   about	   refinement	   and	   fine-­‐tuning	   of	   features	   based	   on	   the	   pilot	   implementation	   and	   feedback	   received	   following	   the	   2nd	   iteration.	   However,	    due	    to	    limitation	    of	    resources	    and	    time,	    a	    number	    of	    features	   requested	    by	    users	    could	    not	    be	    implemented	    in	    the	    prototype.	    Additionally	    a	   range	    of	    features,	    which	    were	    planned	    for	    development	    during	    the	    initial	   functional	   requirements	   development	   and	   development	   of	   system	   architecture	   could	   not	   be	   implemented.	   These	   features	   are	   listed	   in	   5.7	   and	   5.8	   respectively.	   These	   features	   could	   also	   be	   taken	   as	   the	   direction	   for	   future	   research	   and	   are	   further	   discussed	   in	   Chapter	   7.	    	   5.6.3.1	   Interface	   Improvements	   In	   the	   modelling	   window,	   from	   two	   main	   improvements	   were	   made	   regarding	   the	   navigation	   options.	   Options	   to	   “walk”	   and	   “fly”	   around	   the	   model	   were	   added	   following	    requests	    from	    users.	    These	    two	    functions	    make	    navigating	    large	   models	   and	   getting	   a	   snapshot	   view	   of	   the	   project	   much	   simpler.	   Through	   the	   user	   feedback,	   requirement	   for	   more	   graphical	   information	   in	   the	   task	    status	    window	    box	    that	    was	    overlaid	    on	    the	    BIM	    element	    emerged.	   Previously,	   in	   the	   second	   iteration,	   this	   box	   only	   included	   the	   task	   name	   and	   the	   responsible	   actor	   (organisation,	   individual	   or	   the	   team	   performing	   the	   task).	   As	   new	    requirements	    emerged	    during	    evaluations,	    the	    task	    status	    window	    in	    the	   third	   iteration	   included	   a	   traffic	   light	   type	   of	   symbol	   showing	   the	   current	   status	   of	   the	   task	   along	   with	   a	   list	   of	   constraints.	   A	   checkbox	   was	   also	   provided	   next	   to	   the	   constraint	   making	   it	   possible	   to	   release	   constraints	   directly	   from	   this	   box.	    	    	   Additionally,	    a	    visual	    symbol	    on	    the	    planning	    (task)	    window	    and	    its	   corresponding	   BIM	   status	   window	   was	   added	   showing	   resource	   clashes	   (i.e.	   if	   a	   non-­‐consumable	   resource	   such	   as	   a	   crane	   or	   a	   work	   team	   has	   been	   booked	   by	   multiple	    tasks	    at	    the	    same	    time).	    This	    symbol	    will	    help	    identify	    such	    clashes	   effectively	   so	   that	   they	   can	   be	   dealt	   with	   prior	   to	   the	   tasks	   being	   released	   to	   the	   weekly	   plan.	   5.6.3.2	   The	   Planning	   Process	   Two	   workflow	   related	   changes	   were	   made	   to	   the	   planning	   process.	   In	   the	   earlier	   iterations,	   both	   the	   look-­‐ahead	   and	   weekly	   planning	   process	   involved	   the	   user	   having	    to	    select	    the	    tasks	    from	    a	    list	    manually,	    which	    were	    then	    added	    to	    the	   respective	   plan.	   The	   feedback	   from	   the	   users	   was	   that	   this	   added	   an	   unnecessary	   action,	   and	   once	   the	   look-­‐ahead	   and	   weekly	   planning	   windows	   were	   defined	   the	   tasks	    should	    be	    automatically	    added	    to	    that	    plan.	    If	    a	    certain	    task	    cannot	    be	   “made	    ready”	    the	    system	    should	    provide	    an	    option	    to	    remove	    it.	    Hence,	    this	   minor	   change	   was	   applied.	    	   The	   other	   major	   change	   request	   received	   from	   users	   was	   regarding	   the	   auditing	   (or	    change	    tracking)	    capability	    of	    the	    system.	    The	    previous	    iterations	    of	    the	   VisiLean	   system	   deployed	   logging	   capability,	   however	   the	   logging	   was	   mainly	   to	   track	    system	    errors	    and	    not	    changes	    made	    to	    tasks,	    which	    was	    not	    made	   available	    to	    end	    users.	    However,	    the	    users	    highlighted	    that	    this	    is	    one	    of	    the	   major	   pitfalls	   of	   the	   current	   manual	   processes,	   that	   the	   decisions	   taken	   during	   planning	   sessions	   and	   also	   during	   execution	   are	   not	   logged	   and	   hence	   cannot	   be	   tracked	    back	    when	    needed	    in	    future.	    Such	    track	    changes	    facility	    would	    enable	   the	   analysis	   in	   case	   something	   went	   wrong,	   or	   simply	   to	   add	   to	   the	   knowledge	   of	   the	   team	   during	   the	   later	   stages	   of	   the	   project.	   Hence	   a	   facility	   was	   added,	   where	   the	   VisiLean	   system	   would	   keep	   track	   of	   all	   the	   changes	   made	   to	   tasks,	   and	   users	   can	   add	   reasons	   when	   major	   scheduling	   changes	   are	   made	   to	   the	   tasks.	   A	   report	   is	    then	    provided	    which	    would	    make	    available	    the	    audit	    trail	    linked	    to	    any	   particular	   task	   or	   phase.	    	   5.6.3.3	   Resource	   Management	   A	   visual	   icon	   was	   displayed	   on	   the	   task	   window	   and	   also	   in	   the	   BIM	   window	   (in	   the	   task	   status	   window)	   to	   indicate	   if	   there	   was	   a	   conflict	   due	   to	   a	   resource	   being	   booked	   to	   multiple	   tasks	   at	   the	   same	   time.	   This	   visual	   icon	   will	   indicate	   which	   tasks	   are	   clashing	   and	   prompt	   the	   user	   to	   take	   action.	    	   5.6.3.4	   Reporting	   None	    of	    the	    previous	    iterations	    of	    the	    software	    implemented	    any	    reporting	   features.	    Following	    the	    discussions	    with	    the	    potential	    users,	    it	    was	    decided	    to	   develop	   a	   reporting	   feature	   that	   would	   include	   the	   following	   reports.	   • PPC	   –	   one	   of	   the	   most	   important	   measure	   in	   the	   lean	   planning	   process	   is	   the	    “percentage	    plan	    complete”,	    which	    shows	    the	    percentage	    of	    tasks	   complete	   in	   any	   given	   week	   and	   plots	   it	   on	   a	   graph	   with	   time	   represented	   on	    the	    horizontal	    axis.	    In	    VisiLean	    a	    PPC	    chart	    will	    be	    automatically	   provided	    based	    on	    the	    performance	    of	    weekly	    execution	    plans.	    In	   VisiLean	   it	   is	   also	   possible	   to	   output	   a	   PPC	   chart	   for	   any	   given	   duration	   or	   for	   a	   sub-­‐contractor.	   • Reason	    for	    non-­‐completion	   –	   When	   a	   task	   can’t	   be	   executed	   from	   the	   weekly	   plan,	   the	   foreman	   (or	   the	   task	   leader)	   has	   to	   provide	   a	   reason	   why	   the	    task	    wasn’t	    performed	    within	    the	    given	    timeframe.	    The	    reason	    for	   non-­‐completion	    tracks	    these	    reasons	    over	    a	    project	    duration	    and	    are	   represented	   through	   a	   pie	   chart	   in	   VisiLean.	   Similar	   to	   PPC,	   it	   is	   possible	   to	   output	   this	   report	   for	   a	   given	   duration	   or	   a	   by	   a	   subcontractor.	   • A3	   Weekly	   report	   –	   The	   weekly	   report	   is	   a	   combination	   of	   PPC,	   Reasons	   for	   non-­‐completion	   and	   a	   list	   of	   next	   week’s	   tasks	   and	   the	   status	   of	   their	   constraints.	   5.6.3.5	   Communication	   Similar	   to	   reporting,	   communication	   was	   also	   a	   new	   feature	   in	   the	   3rd	   iteration,	   and	    also	    very	    important.	    A	    number	    of	    communication	    requirements	    emerged	   during	   the	   demonstrations	   of	   the	   1st	   and	   2nd	   iterations,	   where	   one	   of	   the	   most	   requested	    requirement	    was	    that	    to	    notify	    the	    actor	    (team/individual)	   performing	    the	    next	    task	    when	    the	    predecessor	    is	    completed	    (however,	    the	   execution	   of	   the	   next	   task	   could	   only	   start	   if	   it	   is	   free	   of	   constraints).	   Similarly,	   the	   system	   will	   send	   a	   message	   to	   the	   actor	   performing	   the	   particular	   task	   and	   the	   next	   one	   in	   line	   if	   it	   is	   getting	   close	   to	   the	   deadline	   or	   delayed.	   If	   the	   task	   is	   getting	   significantly	   delayed	   (a	   period	   set	   by	   the	   project	   manager),	   the	   system	   will	    notify	    the	    site	    manager	    and	    the	    project	    manager.	    A	    host	    of	    other	   communication	   tasks	   were	   included	   in	   the	   3rd	   iteration.	    	   Ideally,	   it	   was	   intended	   that	   the	   system	   will	   have	   a	   notification	   centre	   of	   its	   own,	   and	   when	   a	   user	   logs	   in	   to	   the	   system	   he/she	   would	   receive	   the	   messages	   stored	   in	   the	   inbox.	   And	   certain	   messages	   related	   to	   task	   execution	   will	   also	   be	   sent	   via	   text	    messaging	    or	    mobile	    application	    notifications.	    However,	    as	    the	    VisiLean	   system	    does	    not	    yet	    implement	    a	    distributed	    access	    facility	    where	    individual	   users	   can	   login	   and	   access	   to	   the	   system	   is	   controlled,	   such	   a	   feature	   cannot	   be	   implemented.	    Hence,	    it	    was	    decided	    that	    all	    the	    communication	    in	    the	    3rd	   iteration	   will	   be	   carried	   out	   using	   emails.	   The	   system	   would	   generate	   and	   send	   an	   email	   to	   the	   intended	   recipient(s)	   when	   any	   of	   the	   triggers	   set	   by	   the	   system	   is	   activated.	   5.7	   Summary	   and	   Analysis	   of	   Feedback	   This	   section	   summarises	   the	   feedback	   received	   during	   the	   demonstrations	   of	   the	   VisiLean	   prototype	   as	   part	   of	   the	   evaluation	   process.	   A	   tabular	   summary	   of	   the	   feedback	   is	   presented	   in	   Table	   28.	   As	   interviews	   and	   workshops	   fall	   within	   qualitative	   research,	   guiding	   principles	   from	   the	   qualitative	   research	   domain	   were	   applied	   when	   selecting	   interviewees,	   operating	   procedure	   and	   sample	   size.	   The	   discussion	   regarding	   sample	   size	   and	   saturation	    has	    been	    provided	    in	    Chapter	    2.	    With	    the	    feedback	    collection	   exercised	   (through	   interviews	   and	   workshops)	   it	   was	   found	   that	   a	   sample	   size	   of	   5	    was	    sufficient,	    as	    saturation	    seemed	    to	    be	    occurring	    at	    that	    point.	    As	    the	   experts	   belonged	   to	   the	   same	   industry	   and	   had	   somewhat	   similar	   roles	   in	   their	   organisation	   (both	   in	   workshops	   and	   interviews),	   the	   theory	   of	   consensus	   was	   also	   confirmed.	   There	   was	   a	   significant	   repetition	   and	   similarity	   of	   opinion	   in	   the	   responses	    from	    interviewees	    and	    workshop	    attendees.	    However,	    it	    must	    be	   acknowledged	    here	    that	    majority	    of	    the	    respondents	    were	    construction	   professionals	    from	    large	    industrial	    organisations	    and	    it	    is	    possible	    that	    the	   opinions	   could	   have	   been	   different	   if	   the	   range	   of	   professions	   of	   respondents	   had	   been	   wider.	   Also,	   selection	   of	   organisations	   and	   persons	   to	   be	   interviewed	   is	   one	   of	   the	   most	   important	    criteria	    when	    carrying	    out	    qualitative	    studies.	    Nature	    of	    the	   organization,	   size,	   familiarity	   with	   the	   subject	   area	   and	   geographic	   location	   are	   important	   criteria	   for	   selection.	   As	   the	   study	   falls	   within	   the	   realm	   of	   production	   management	   in	   construction,	   and	   specifically	   deals	   with	   lean	   construction	   and	   Building	    Information	    Modelling,	    it	    was	    important	    to	    select	    participants	    who	   would	   be	   familiar	   with	   the	   subject	   area	   and	   have	   previous	   experience	   in	   either	   implementing	    it	    or	    at	    least	    have	    knowledge	    about	    the	    subjects.	    From	    this	   perspective,	   interviewees	   and	   workshop	   participants	   were	   selected	   from	   large	   contracting	    organisations,	    which	    had	    prior	    experience	    of	    Lean	    and	    BIM	   implementation,	   and	   were	   based	   in	   the	   UK	   (with	   the	   exception	   of	   two	   Finnish	   organisations).	   As	   design	   has	   not	   been	   considered	   to	   be	   within	   the	   scope	   of	   this	   research,	    interviewees	    from	    this	    (design)	    background	    were	    not	    selected	    for	   feedback	   collection.	   Table	   28.	   Summary	   of	   feedback	   received	   during	   evaluation.	   Aspect evaluated Feedback and its Analysis Relevance research of All respondents agreed that the research is quite relevant and timely. Almost all respondents (all except #4) mentioned that they are currently implementing both Lean and BIM. However, most organisations expressed a concern that there are no computer-based systems that help with the site based implementation of the Last Planner system (or that they have been custom solutions such as using Excel Spread sheets) causing much manual processing. The representatives of two companies mentioned that they are trying to use both Lean and BIM simultaneously but are facing issues due to a lack of an integrated system. One of the respondents also mentioned that a public sector client has been pushing lean across all projects and there is an internal desire to implement lean, which makes the concept very timely. Usefulness (practicality) Most respondents answered this question as part of answers to other questions. Two respondents mentioned that their current Last Planner™ workflow of using Post-It™ notes and Excel spreadsheets does not keep an Aspect evaluated Feedback and its Analysis audit trail of decisions, and hence it would be useful to have a system that supports a systematic way to support the Last Planner™ system. However, most respondents expressed concern that in the past, many solutions they had tried to implement on site had failed due to the rough working conditions, lack of communication channels, unskilled nature of workforce and high complexity (steep learning curve) of the system being implemented. Hence, they expressed a desire that any solution being implemented should be very simple and intuitive to use with minimal training needed (as worker turnover remains high). Should the research be advanced to further stages (asked at the early stage of research) As a part of the design science/constructive research approach, this question was asked during early demonstrations/discussions about the solutions to identify whether the solution is worthwhile and feasible to carry forward. All participants unanimously agreed that the solution and the concept are relevant and should be developed further. One of the respondents mentioned that in the past such research has failed to make an impact in the industry, i.e. the commercial (software) solution providers continue to provide features supporting CPM based planning and scheduling systems and ICT solutions that do not tackle site based processes or lean workflow efficiently. According to the interviewee, it would be wise to collaborate with a commercial provider so that they would incorporate lean production management and product and process integration, visualisation and synchronisation features in their upcoming software revisions. 	Key 	important features All respondents agreed that    1. support of collaborative planning workflow, and    2. integration with BIM (to support visualisation of production planning) are the two most important features. Others added that having an integrated system would save the considerable effort of maintaining separate database systems and would improve the quality of planning and control functions. Key modifications 	needed 	and missing features Three out of five respondents mentioned that such issues (of needed modifications and missing features) only emerge once the system is pilot tested. However, at least two out of five respondents (and some participants at subsequent workshops) mentioned that adding quantity and cost information to tasks and having an integrated cost/value reconciliation system would be a big advantage. Also, an interviewee who had been using location based scheduling for preparing master plans added that the possibility of adding a location (i.e. dividing the site/project in various locations, either by floor or by zones) to the tasks would be a crucial feature for their company. Implementation test 	and readiness for a pilot All respondents agreed that if such a system were available, they would like to implement it on their projects. This question was asked in terms of Kasanen’s (1993) weak market test, i.e. whether a manager agrees to implement the system in their organisation. Also, all respondents agreed to carry out a pilot project if a suitable project and resources were found. General comments The UK based contractors pointed out demands by the clients as the biggest drivers for lean and BIM implementation. It was also mentioned that having strict access control to manage “who can see what” in the system would be quite important, as such a system cannot be implemented in isolation. The	    feedback	    was	    received	    after	    the	    first	    year	    of	    research,	    when	    an	    initial	   prototype	    (proof	    of	    concept)	    of	    the	    VisiLean	    solution	    was	    presented.	    The	   individuals	    interviewed	    belonged	    to	    large	    construction	    organisations	    (2500	    or	   more	   employees).	   All	   respondents	   were	   familiar	   with	   Lean	   Construction	   process	   and	    were	    implementing	    BIM	    in	    either	    one	    or	    more	    of	    their	    projects.	    This	   proximity/familiarity	    with	    lean	    and	    BIM	    was	    one	    of	    the	    main	    criteria	    for	   selection	   of	   participants	   in	   both	   interviews	   and	   workshops.	    	   The	    first	    set	    of	    interviews	    gave	    an	    early	    insight	    into	    the	    requirements	    and	   whether	    the	    research	    solution	    was	    relevant	    to	    the	    industry	    (it	    is	    one	    of	    the	   primary	    requirements	    of	    the	    constructive	    research/design	    science	    approach).	   The	   feedback	   received	   was	   taken	   into	   consideration	   when	   designing	   the	   VisiLean	   prototype	   further.	    	   5.8	   Unimplemented	   features	   As	    reported	    earlier,	    due	    to	    time	    and	    resource	    constraints	    not	    all	    features	   identified	   as	   missing	   through	   discussions	   or	   which	   participants	   requested	   during	   demonstrations	    and	    pilot	    implementation	    could	    be	    implemented	    in	    the	    three	   iterations	    outlined	    above.	    This	    list	    is	    slightly	    different	    from	    “plan	    for	    future	   development”	   list	   below	   in	   section	   5.9	   as	   the	   features	   listed	   in	   this	   section	   were	   already	   identified	   in	   the	   beginning	   of	   the	   project	   and	   were	   known	   to	   the	   research	   team	    as	    being	    out	    of	    scope	    for	    current	    development.	    However,	    for	    future	   development,	   both	   sets	   of	   features,	   as	   listed	   in	   Section	   5.8	   and	   Section	   5.9	   are	   important.	    	   5.8.1	   Cost	   and	   quantity	   integration	   within	   the	   task	   management	   Two	    of	    the	    most	    requested	    features	    during	    the	    demonstrations	    were	    the	   inclusion	    of	    cost	    and	    quantity	    data	    from	    the	    BIM	    model	    and	    also	    from	    the	   Tendering	   and	   Estimating	   database.	   It	   is	   now	   possible	   to	   extract	   quantity	   data	   from	   BIM	   models	   if	   the	   models	   are	   accurately	   developed	   and	   detailed.	   Similarly	   it	   is	   possible	   to	   link	   the	   cost	   database	   either	   directly	   within	   the	   BIM	   software	   or	   through	   external	   cost	   management	   systems.	   Also,	   if	   models	   were	   not	   used	   during	   the	   tendering	   and	   estimation	   phase,	   another	   set	   of	   quantity	   and	   cost	   information	   could	   be	   available	   (which	   could	   also	   include	   resource	   information,	   i.e.	   amount	   of	   resources	    allocated	    to	    each	    work	    package).	    During	    demonstrations	    and	   discussions	   it	   was	   identified	   that	   access	   to	   this	   information	   would	   help	   during	   planning	    and	    execution	    and	    also	    would	    also	    make	    it	    possible	    to	    carry	    out	   comparative	   analysis	   between	   the	   planned	   and	   actual	   consumption	   of	   resources.	   In	   future,	   if	   the	   facility	   to	   capture	   cost	   data	   during	   execution,	   it	   could	   be	   possible	   to	    generate	    reports	    such	    as	    “Cost	    Value	    Reconciliation”	    directly	    from	    the	   VisiLean	   system.	   5.8.2	   Quality	   and	   safety	   management	   workflow	   In	    lean,	    quality	    is	    part	    of	    the	    production	    planning	    and	    control	    and	    is	    not	    a	   separate	   function	   as	   such.	   Each	   worker	   in	   the	   production	   system	   is	   responsible	   for	    managing	    quality	    and	    ensuring	    that	    each	    product	    meets	    the	    standards.	   However,	   in	   practice	   this	   has	   not	   yet	   been	   realised	   in	   construction	   and	   also	   from	   contractual	    perspective	    there	    may	    be	    requirements	    that	    have	    to	    be	    met	    to	   demonstrate	    a	    task	    meets	    the	    quality	    requirements.	    During	    the	    pilot	    project	   implementation	    of	    VisiLean,	    and	    also	    during	    other	    demonstrations,	    users	   requested	   a	   quality	   and	   safety	   management	   workflow	   feature.	   From	    quality	    management	    perspective,	    the	    users	    requested	    that	    following	    the	   completion	   of	   each	   task,	   the	   task	   supervisor	   (or	   the	   internal	   quality	   assurance	   authority)	    should	    be	    notified	    so	    that	    he/she	    can	    carry	    out	    the	    inspection	    and	   mark	    the	    task	    as	    complete.	    Following	    this	    internal	    inspection,	    if	    needed	    the	   external	   authority	   (mostly	   client	   or	   a	   client	   representative)	   should	   be	   notified	   to	   carry	    out	    the	    final	    inspection	    and	    marking	    the	    task	    as	    complete	    to	    the	   satisfactory	    standard.	    It	    was	    requested	    that	    these	    actions	    should	    also	    be	   recorded	    and	    the	    system	    should	    provide	    a	    facility	    for	    the	    user(s)	    to	    attach	   photographs	   or	   other	   media	   files	   to	   tasks	   in	   VisiLean.	    	   Similar	    to	    quality,	    safety	    is	    also	    an	    integral	    part	    of	    the	    lean	    production	   management	   system.	   Due	   to	   the	   highly	   visual	   nature	   of	   the	   VisiLean	   system	   and	   much	   detailed	   planning	   capabilities,	   several	   users	   pointed	   out	   the	   opportunity	   to	   carry	    out	    safety	    analysis	    of	    planned	    work	    during	    the	    collaborative	    planning	   sessions.	   In	   VisiLean	   it	   is	   anticipated	   that	   the	   worker	   in	   charge	   of	   safety	   (safety	   manager)	   should	   be	   given	   access	   to	   the	   system,	   so	   that	   he/she	   can	   approve	   the	   weekly	    plan	    (preferably	    during	    the	    weekly	    meetings)	    in	    the	    system	    and	   authorise	   the	   work	   to	   start.	   This	   could	   also	   be	   treated	   similar	   to	   the	   constraints	   management	    and	    the	    tasks	    could	    only	    be	    released	    to	    workers	    once	    the	    safety	   manager	   has	   approved	   the	   plan.	   5.8.3	   Multiple	   task	   visualisations	   in	   the	   model	   window	   Currently	   there	   is	   a	   one-­‐to-­‐one	   mapping	   between	   a	   task	   in	   the	   planning	   window	   and	    the	    task	    status	    window	    in	    the	    (BIM)	    model.	    However,	    feedback	    received	   from	   participants	   indicated	   that	   it	   would	   be	   valuable	   to	   select	   multiple	   tasks	   in	   the	    planning	    window,	    where	    their	    respective	    status	    is	    displayed	    in	    the	    model	   window	    through	    the	    task	    status	    window	    and	    also	    through	    colour	    coding.	    For	   example,	   selecting	   a	   phase	   in	   the	   planning	   window	   would	   select	   and	   highlight	   all	   BIM	    elements	    in	    the	    model	    window,	    which	    are	    linked	    to	    the	    tasks	    that	    are	   planned	   under	   that	   phase.	   This	   way	   it	   would	   be	   possible	   to	   visually	   check	   the	   status	   tasks	   in	   a	   quick	   and	   efficient	   way.	   5.8.4	   BIM	   based	   task	   creation	   Currently	   there	   are	   two	   ways	   to	   create	   a	   task(s)	   in	   VisiLean,	   either	   by	   importing	   it	    from	    other	    planning	    software	    or	    by	    creating	    it	    directly	    in	    the	    planning	   application.	    However,	    during	    demonstrations	    a	    request	    for	    a	    new	    method	    of	   creating	    tasks	    was	    received;	    whereby	    selecting	    a	    model	    element	    in	    the	    BIM	   window	   and	   clicking	   a	   button	   would	   automatically	   create	   a	   task	   with	   pre-­‐defined	   information	   from	   the	   BIM	   model.	   Here,	   information	   such	   as	   the	   element	   name,	   hierarchy	    in	    the	    project,	    quantity	    and	    cost	    data	    (if	    present)	    and	    other	   geometrical	   data	   would	   be	   used	   to	   populate	   certain	   fields.	   The	   new	   task	   will	   be	   created	   under	   a	   phase,	   which	   is	   selected	   before	   clicking	   the	   “create	   task”	   button.	   The	   main	   benefit	   of	   providing	   this	   option	   to	   the	   users	   it	   to	   make	   the	   system	   as	   user	   friendly	   and	   intuitive	   as	   possible,	   as	   this	   method	   of	   task	   creation	   is	   not	   only	   highly	    visual,	    but	    also	    has	    a	    potential	    to	    save	    time	    by	    populating	    the	    task	   information	   extracted	   from	   the	   model.	    	   5.8.5	   Resource	   Booking	   Management	   Following	   the	   changes	   made	   to	   resource	   management	   in	   iteration	   2,	   where	   the	   distinction	    between	    consumable	    and	    non-­‐consumable	    resources	    was	    made,	    in	   the	   third	   iteration,	   a	   booking	   management	   system	   was	   added	   which	   would	   let	   the	   users	   allocate	   a	   certain	   resource	   to	   a	   task	   for	   a	   pre-­‐defined	   period.	   During	   the	    demonstrations	    of	    the	    second	    iteration,	    the	    users	    highlighted	    a	    particular	   need	   to	   book	   high-­‐demand	   resources	   such	   as	   cranes	   and	   specialised	   equipment	   or	    spaces,	    which	    will	    enable	    a	    much	    tighter	    control	    of	    such	    resources	    and	   minimise	   clashes	   with	   other	   tasks.	   As	   a	   result,	   a	   feature	   to	   book	   time-­‐slots	   for	   individual	   non-­‐consumable	   resources	   was	   implemented.	    	   5.9	   Plans	   for	   Future	   Development	   As	   mentioned	   above,	   there	   was	   a	   set	   of	   features,	   which	   although	   were	   planned	   from	   the	   outset	   and	   were	   part	   of	   the	   initial	   functional	   specifications,	   could	   not	   be	   implemented	    in	    the	    three	    iterations	    of	    VisiLean	    due	    to	    time	    and	    resource	   constraints.	    However,	    VisiLean	    research	    is	    ongoing,	    and	    it	    is	    hoped	    that	    these	   features	   along	   with	   the	   unimplemented	   features	   described	   in	   Section	   5.8	   should	   be	    prioritised	    for	    in	    future	    iterations.	    These	    features	    are	    outlined	    in	    the	   following.	   5.9.1	   Mobile	   Interfaces	   From	   the	   outset,	   development	   of	   mobile	   interfaces	   was	   recognised	   as	   one	   of	   the	   core	    features	    of	    VisiLean.	    As	    construction	    is	    a	    field-­‐based	    activity	    the	    use	    of	   physically	    constrained	    technological	    equipment	    (such	    as	    a	    desktop	    PCs),	    to	   access	    a	    production	    management	    system	    such	    as	    VisiLean	    may	    not	    be	   appropriate,	   and	   also	   as	   the	   use	   of	   laptop	   computers	   in	   the	   field	   could	   prove	   to	   be	    cumbersome.	    On	    the	    other	    hand	    mobile	    technologies	    such	    as	    Tablet	   computers	   and	   smart	   phones	   are	   becoming	   highly	   sophisticated	   and	   powerful,	   increasingly	    being	    used	    on	    construction	    site.	    Most	    BIM	    software	    vendors,	   including	    AutoDesk,	    Bentley,	    Tekla,	    and	    Graphisoft	    now	    have	    applications	    on	   mobile	   platforms	   that	   help	   visualise	   the	   model	   in	   the	   field.	    	   VisiLean	    being	    a	    production	    management	    application,	    a	    significant	    amount	    of	   information	    could	    be	    used	    to	    support	    execution	    activities	    in	    the	    field.	    The	   following	   activities	   will	   benefit	   from	   development	   of	   mobile	   interfaces:	   • Accessing	    planned	    tasks	    (for	    a	    given	    team	    or	    individual),	    and	    their	   current	   status	   • Starting,	   stopping	   and	   completing	   tasks	   by	   simply	   clicking	   a	   button	   • Taking	   pictures	   and	   videos	   of	   and	   linking	   them	   to	   tasks	   (for	   example,	   of	   completed	   tasks,	   innovative	   ideas	   or	   problems).	   • Accessing	   task	   and	   model	   related	   information	   when	   needed	   None	   of	   the	   current	   BIM	   viewers	   on	   the	   mobile	   platforms	   provide	   access	   through	   API	    (Application	    Programming	    Interface)	    and	    hence	    it	    is	    not	    possible	    to	    link	   VisiLean	   to	   them,	   however	   once	   the	   viewers	   with	   API	   are	   made	   available,	   model	   integration	   on	   the	   mobile	   interface	   will	   be	   considered.	   5.9.2	   Knowledge	   Management	   Knowledge	   Management	   in	   production	   management	   involves	   sharing	   tacit	   and	   explicit	    knowledge	    with	    co-­‐workers	    and	    is	    a	    core	    part	    of	    the	    continuous	   improvement	    cycle	    in	    lean	    construction.	    There	    are	    a	    number	    of	    platforms	    or	   solutions	   for	   sharing	   explicit	   information,	   such	   as	   Project	   Extranets,	   Emails,	   and	   other	   project	   information	   management	   systems.	   BIM	   can	   also	   be	   viewed	   as	   one	   such	    platform,	    which	    enables	    sharing	    explicit	    product	    information.	    However,	   capturing	    tacit	    knowledge	    is	    more	    difficult	    and	    there	    is	    a	    general	    absence	    of	   systems,	    which	    help	    with	    collaborative	    sharing	    of	    tacit	    knowledge.	    With	    the	   advancement	   of	   Social	   Networking	   applications	   such	   as	   forums,	   blogs,	   wikis	   and	   other	    platforms	    such	    as	    Twitter,	    can	    be	    used	    for	    collaborative	    knowledge	   sharing.	   These	   applications	   are	   successful	   in	   sharing	   tacit	   knowledge	   especially	   due	   to	   their	   informal	   and	   social	   nature,	   which	   nurtures	   and	   supports	   sharing	   of	   knowledge	   within	   communities	   (Dave	   and	   Koskela,	   2009).	   In	   VisiLean,	   a	   task	   centric	   knowledge	   management	   solution	   is	   anticipated,	   which	   will	   let	   users	   discuss	   any	   issues	   related	   to	   a	   particular	   task.	   There	   will	   also	   be	   an	   open	   space	   for	   discussion	   related	   to	   general	   issues	   (and	   not	   to	   a	   particular	   task).	   A	   combination	   of	   social	   media	   tools	   such	   as	   an	   online	   forum	   and	   twitter	   will	   be	   used	    that	    provide	    a	    user	    experience	    that	    is	    almost	    real-­‐time	    and	    personal.	   Through	   such	   an	   integrated	   platform,	   the	   users	   will	   be	   able	   to	   discuss	   ideas,	   take	   them	    through	    a	    cycle	    of	    refinement	    through	    discussion	    and	    develop	    solutions,	   which	   are	   then	   documented	   and	   shared	   across	   a	   wider	   community.	    	   5.9.3	   Simulation	   of	   a	   look-­‐ahead	   or	   weekly	   plan	   Currently	   in	   VisiLean	   (iteration	   3),	   it	   is	   not	   possible	   to	   simulate	   either	   the	   look-­‐ahead	    or	    weekly	    plan.	    During	    discussions	    with	    potential	    users,	    and	   demonstrations	   the	   requests	   for	   simulating	   these	   plans	   were	   received.	   Users	   saw	   the	   potential	   and	   benefit	   in	   visualising	   the	   sequence	   of	   selected	   tasks	   to	   identify	   any	    sequencing	    issues	    and	    also	    to	    understand	    the	    execution	    plan	    in	    a	    more	   detail.	    As	    currently	    the	    VisiLean	    application	    uses	    Navisworks,	    which	   incorporates	   a	   4D	   simulation	   engine	   (which	   is	   accessible	   through	   API),	   it	   would	   be	   possible	   to	   simulate	   a	   selection	   of	   tasks	   in	   4D.	    	   5.10	   Summary	   In	    this	    Chapter,	    the	    process	    followed	    while	    designing	    and	    developing	    the	   production	   management	   solution	   in	   response	   to	   the	   problem	   outlined	   in	   Chapter	   3	   and	   opportunities	   identified	   in	   Chapter	   4	   was	   described.	   The	   main	   goal	   of	   this	   solution,	   i.e.	   to	   provide	   computer	   system	   support	   to	   the	   production	   management	   processes	    was	    achieved	    by	    carefully	    identifying	    the	    core	    production	   management	    requirements	    and	    then	    requirements	    from	    previous	    research.	   Based	    on	    this	    and	    also	    through	    discussions	    with	    participants,	    a	    framework	    of	   requirements	    for	    a	    production	    management	    system	    was	    developed.	    This	   framework	    was	    then	    developed	    into	    three	    main	    categories,	    i.e.	    functional	   requirements,	   technology	   requirements	   and	   user	   interface	   requirements.	    	   After	   careful	   consideration,	   Scrum	   from	   the	   Agile	   Development	   methodology	   was	   selected	   and	   followed	   throughout	   the	   project.	   As	   Scrum	   is	   a	   highly	   iterative	   and	   incremental	    process,	    there	    were	    short	    loops	    of	    design,	    development	    and	   evaluation.	   However,	   for	   sake	   of	   simplicity,	   the	   development	   was	   categorised	   in	   three	   main	   iterations,	   which	   have	   been	   described	   in	   Section	   5.6.	   While	   designing	   VisiLean	   features	   and	   going	   through	   the	   development	   iteration	   cycle,	   experience	   and	    knowledge	    of	    external	    research	    participants	    were	    very	    useful	    and	   contributed	    to	    the	    robustness	    of	    the	    solution.	    The	    constant	    feedback	    received	   from	    the	    research	    participants	    through	    workshops,	    demonstrations	    and	   meetings	   was	   taken	   into	   consideration	   while	   designing	   and	   developing	   VisiLean,	   and	   it	   was	   an	   incremental	   process,	   however,	   for	   the	   sake	   of	   clarity	   the	   evaluation	   process	   will	   be	   discussed	   in	   Chapter	   6.	    	   Selecting	   the	   technology	   platform	   and	   developing	   the	   system	   architecture	   were	   complex	   and	   time-­‐consuming	   processes,	   due	   to	   a	   large	   number	   of	   options	   to	   be	   evaluated.	   In	   the	   current	   solution,	   Autodesk	   Navisworks	   has	   been	   chosen	   as	   the	   BIM	   technology	   platform,	   however	   the	   architecture	   has	   been	   designed	   in	   such	   a	   way	    (by	    keeping	    the	    business	    logic	    of	    process	    and	    product	    visualisation	   independent)	    that	    in	    future	    any	    BIM	    solution	    that	    satisfies	    the	    criteria	    can	    be	   selected,	   as	   long	   as	   it	   can	   be	   accessed	   through	   an	   API.	   This	   aspect	   will	   enable	   the	   potential	   users	   select	   whichever	   technology	   platform	   they	   are	   familiar	   with,	   and	   also	    enable	    development	    of	    multiple	    solutions	    with	    a	    range	    of	    technological	   platforms.	   For	   future	   research,	   one	   of	   the	   most	   significant	   change	   will	   be	   move	   towards	   a	   web	   enabled	   system,	   either	   through	   a	   complete	   move	   to	   a	   web	   based	   solution,	   or	   a	   combination	   of	   desktop	   and	   web	   based	   applications	   which	   allow	   distributed	   access	    to	    the	    system,	    and	    granular	    access	    control.	    The	    main	    constraint	    in	   developing	    a	    complete	    web	    based	    system	    is	    the	    current	    unavailability	    of	    a	   capable	   BIM	   platform	   that	   has	   a	   web	   interface	   (for	   at	   least	   model	   visualisation)	   and	   which	   offers	   a	   capable	   API.	   This	   however	   is	   changing	   fast	   as	   a	   number	   of	   new	    solutions	    are	    coming	    to	    market.	    Also,	    by	    using	    a	    programming	    language	   such	   as	   HTML	   5,	   the	   application	   can	   be	   browser	   based,	   but	   can	   also	   be	   accessed	   through	   mobile	   devices.	   Hence,	   it	   could	   truly	   function	   as	   a	   Universal	   application,	   which	    is	    accessible	    from	    all	    platforms	    (including	    Mac,	    PC,	    Linux,	    Android	    and	   iOS).	    	   The	    other	    significant	    change	    that	    is	    anticipated	    in	    future	    releases	    is	    how	    the	   application	   synchronises	   or	   integrates	   flow	   information	   (regarding	   constraints).	   Currently	    the	    project	    administration	    information	    has	    to	    be	    input	    manually,	   however,	    going	    forward,	    use	    of	    web-­‐services	    to	    dynamically	    link	    to	    relevant	   information	   systems	   (such	   as	   procurement,	   asset	   database,	   estimating,	   etc.)	   will	   reduce	   the	   requirement	   of	   manual	   input	   and	   increase	   the	   accuracy	   and	   speed	   of	   information	   availability.	    	   Section	    5.6	    describe	    the	    current	    features	    of	    VisiLean	    and	    their	    development	   process	   while	   section	   5.7	   provides	   a	   summary	   of	   the	   feedback	   received	   during	   evaluations	    and	    their	    analysis.	    Subsequently,	    Sections	    5.8	    and	    5.9,	    outline	    the	   features	   that	   could	   not	   be	   implemented	   in	   the	   current	   version.	    	   It	   should	   be	   noted	   that	   as	   VisiLean	   has	   been	   developed	   as	   a	   research	   system	   with	   limited	   resources,	   and	   mainly	   as	   a	   proof	   of	   concept	   of	   a	   Lean	   and	   BIM	   system,	   it	   lacks	    the	    sophistication	    of	    a	    commercially	    available	    system	    and	    has	    many	   limitations.	   Overall,	   the	   design	   and	   development	   of	   VisiLean	   has	   been	   through	   an	   iterative	   and	    incremental	    process,	    where	    constant	    feedback	    from	    the	    industry	    helped	   refine	    many	    of	    its	    features.	    VisiLean	    is	    still	    a	    prototype	    system	    with	    many	   limitations,	    and	    future	    research	    and	    development	    can	    potentially	    make	    it	    a	   capable	    production	    management	    system	    that	    will	    help	    integrate,	    synchronise	   and	   visualise	   information	   for	   efficient	   production	   management	   on	   a	   construction	   project.	   	   
6	   Evaluation	   of	   VisiLean	   6.1	   Introduction	   and	   selection	   of	   evaluation	   methods	   Evaluation	   as	   a	   part	   of	   design	   science	   method	   was	   presented	   in	   Chapter	   2.	   Here	   a	   detailed	    explanation	    of	    the	    evaluation	    methodologies	    and	    the	    appropriate	   process	   followed	   for	   VisiLean	   evaluation	   is	   provided.	    	   All	    major	    authors	    on	    design	    science	    emphasise	    the	    need	    for	    a	    definition	    of	   appropriate	   metrics	   to	   evaluate	   the	   design	   artefact	   (Hevner	   et	   al.,	   2004;	   March	   and	    Smith,	    1995;	    Lukka	    2003).	    Hevner	    et	    al.	    (2004)	    provide	    factors	    against	   which	   IT	   artefacts	   can	   be	   evaluated:	   • Functionality	   • Completeness	   • Consistency	   • Accuracy	   • Performance	   • Reliability	   • Usability	   • Fit	   with	   the	   organisation	   and	   others	   As	   discussed	   in	   the	   previous	   section,	   design	   and	   development	   of	   an	   information	   system	    is	    an	    incremental	    process.	    As	    a	    result	    the	    evaluation	    phase	    provides	   essential	   feedback	   to	   the	   construction	   phase	   regarding	   the	   quality	   of	   the	   design	   process	   and	   the	   artefact	   that	   is	   being	   developed.	    	   Hevner	   et	   al.	   (2004)	   mention	   that	   the	   evaluation	   of	   the	   artefacts	   typically	   uses	   methodologies	    available	    in	    the	    knowledge	    base.	    They	    provide	    a	    summary	    of	   these	    methods,	    which	    is	    provided	    in	    Table	    29.	    It	    is	    well	    established	    that	    the	   efficacy	    and	    goodness	    of	    an	    artefact	    can	    be	    rigorously	    demonstrated	    by	    well-­selected	   evaluation	   methods	   (Basili	   1996).	   Table	   29.	   Design	   Evaluation	   Methods	   (Hevner	   et	   al.,	   2004).	   1. Observational Case study – Study artefact in depth in business environment Field Study – Monitor use of artefact in multiple projects 2. Analytical Static analysis – Examine structure of artefact for static qualities (e.g. complexity) Architecture Analysis – Study fit of artefact into technical IS (Information Science) architecture Optimisation – Demonstrate inherent optimal properties of artefact or provide optimality bounds on artefact behaviour Dynamic analysis – Study artefact in use for dynamic qualities (e.g. performance) 3. Experimental Controlled Experiment – Study artefact in controlled environment for qualities (e.g. usability) Simulation – Execute artefact with artificial data 4. Testing Functional (Black Box) Testing – Execute artefact interfaces to discover failures and identify defects Structural (White Box) Testing – Perform coverage testing of some metric (e.g. execution paths) in the artefact implementation 5. Descriptive Informed argument – Use information from the knowledge base (e.g. relevant research) to build a convincing argument for the artefacts utility Scenarios – Construct detailed scenarios around the artefact to demonstrate its utility  As	   the	   design	   of	   the	   artefact	   goes	   through	   different	   stages,	   it	   may	   be	   necessary	   to	   use	   appropriate	   evaluation	   methods.	   The	   following	   approaches	   were	   taken	   into	   consideration	   while	   evaluating	   VisiLean.	    	   6.1.1	   Analytical	   As	    mentioned	    by	    Hevner	    (2004)	    and	    shown	    in	    Table	    29,	    the	    static	    analysis	   method	   of	   evaluation	   helps	   to	   evaluate/examine	   the	   structure	   of	   the	   artefact	   for	   static	    qualities	    such	    as	    complexity.	    Here	    a	    range	    of	    methods	    such	    as	   demonstrations,	   interviews	   and	   workshops	   with	   focus	   user	   groups	   were	   utilised	   to	   receive	   feedback	   while	   evaluating	   VisiLean.	   While	   designing	   VisiLean	   it	   was	   crucial	   to	   understand	   whether	   the	   functionality	   and	    behaviour	    of	    the	    system	    conforms	    to	    the	    requirements	    (here	    from	    the	   context	    of	    production	    management	    system).	    User	    feedback	    gathering	    started	   very	    early	    in	    the	    process	    as	    key	    participating	    user	    groups	    were	    consulted	   through	    interviews,	    workshops	    and	    demonstrations.	    The	    feedback	    was	    then	   used	   to	   improve	   the	   system	   in	   an	   iterative	   and	   incremental	   way.	   This	   approach	   is	   also	   consistent	   with	   the	   agile	   project	   management	   technique	   used	   for	   software	   development.	    The	    details	    of	    the	    feedback	    gathered	    during	    these	    sessions	    is	   provided	   in	   Appendix	   A	   and	   discussed	   further	   below.	   6.1.2	   Observational	    	   The	    Case	    study	    method	    of	    evaluation	    through	    a	    pilot	    implementation	    on	    a	   construction	    project	    is	    very	    important	    as	    no	    other	    method	    provides	    more	   accurate	    results	    than	    conducting	    an	    in	    depth	    pilot	    implementation	    within	   business	   environment.	   In	   this	   case	   a	   motorway	   automation	   project	   was	   selected	   for	    pilot	    implementation	    described	    in	    section	    6.3.	    The	    selection	    of	    the	    project	   was	   based	   on	   the	   following	   criteria:	   • Access	   to	   project.	   As	   the	   client	   (a	   major	   public	   sector	   client	   in	   the	   UK)	   and	   the	   contractor	   were	   already	   participating	   in	   the	   VisiLean	   research,	   access	   to	   the	   project	   was	   made	   available.	   This	   is	   one	   of	   the	   crucial	   requirements	   in	   a	   design	   science	   project.	   Without	   access	   to	   a	   suitable	   project,	   it	   is	   not	   possible	   to	   conduct	   in-­‐depth	   pilot	   implementation.	   It	   should	   be	   noted	   that	   a	   significant	   amount	   of	   “marketing”	   by	   the	   author	   was	   needed	   to	   secure	   the	   access	   to	   pilot	   project	   even	   as	   the	   stakeholders	   were	   participants	   in	   the	   project.	   • Nature	    of	    the	    project.	    As	    VisiLean	    is	    a	    production	    management	    system	   that	    supports	    collaborative	    planning,	    detailed	    constraints	    analysis	    and	   integrates	   with	   a	   Building	   Information	   Model,	   it	   was	   necessary	   that	   the	   selected	    project	    was	    already	    following	    collaborative	    planning	    methods	   and	   had	   an	   operational	   parametric	   model	   (Building	   Information	   Model)	   available.	   Selecting	   a	   project	   where	   collaborative	   planning	   were	   not	   being	   followed	    would	    have	    been	    a	    significant	    challenge	    as	    significant	    training	   and	    cultural	    change	    are	    needed	    before	    collaborative	    planning	    methods	   can	   be	   used.	   Following	    the	    pilot	    implementation,	    significant	    feedback	    was	    captured,	    which	   helped	   validate	   major	   concepts	   behind	   VisiLean	   design	   and	   the	   usability	   of	   the	   system	   within	   a	   “live”	   project	   environment.	   The	   design	   framework	   was	   updated	   based	   on	   the	   feedback	   received.	    	   There	   were	   a	   number	   of	   limitations	   of	   the	   pilot	   project,	   mainly	   due	   to	   the	   factors	   that	    were	    outside	    the	    control	    of	    the	    author	    (internal	    organisational	    processes,	   availability	   of	   resources	   within	   research	   organisation,	   client	   organisation	   and	   the	   main	    contractors’	    organisation).	    One	    of	    the	    main	    limitation	    was	    that	    the	    pilot	   project	    initiated	    quite	    late	    during	    the	    research.	    As	    a	    result,	    while	    it	    was	    only	   possible	    to	    revise	    the	    framework	    (or	    system	    architecture)	    behind	    VisiLean,	    it	   was	    not	    possible	    to	    re-­‐programme	    the	    prototype	    and	    re-­‐implement	    to	    test	    it	   again.	    	   6.1.3	   Experimental	   As	    shown	    in	    Table	    29	    there	    are	    two	    types	    of	    experimental	    methods	    used	    in	   design	    science,	    namely	    Controlled	    Experiment	    and	    Simulation.	    Both	    these	   methods	    are	    used	    to	    evaluate	    the	    newly	    designed	    artefact	    where	    it	    is	    not	   possible	   to	   conduct	   a	   live	   demonstration	   or	   implementation	   directly	   within	   the	   industry.	    As	    discussed	    below,	    both	    these	    methods	    were	    partially	    used	    while	   evaluating	   VisiLean	   in	   conjunction	   with	   other	   methods.	   6.1.3.1	   Controlled	   Experiment	    	   The	    VisiLean	    system	    was	    tested	    regularly	    within	    controlled	    environment	    to	   check	    for	    performance	    against	    set	    parameters	    such	    as	    usability,	    individual	   functions	   (such	   as	   constraints	   analysis,	   integration	   with	   BIM,	   etc.)	   6.1.3.2	   Simulation	   Sample	   Building	   Information	   Models	   and	   project	   management	   data	   were	   used	   to	   simulate	   the	   behaviour	   of	   Visi	   Lean.	   The	   above-­‐mentioned	   methods	   of	   feedback	   gathering	   and	   pilot	   implementation	   required	    significant	    interaction	    with	    participants	    from	    the	    industry.	    As	   development	   of	   an	   information	   system	   artefact	   is	   a	   complex	   and	   intense	   process,	   it	    requires	    constant	    evaluation	    against	    performance	    criteria.	    Therefore	    the	   research	    team	    used	    the	    experimental	    evaluation	    methods	    throughout	    the	   development	    to	    continually	    test	    the	    VisiLean	    system.	    In	    the	    controlled	   experiment	    methods,	    the	    research	    team	    constantly	    evaluated	    newly	   implemented	    functions	    and	    reported	    back	    any	    bugs	    or	    functional	    requirement	   change	    requests,	    which	    were	    then	    considered	    for	    development	    in	    subsequent	   iteration	    of	    VisiLean.	    This	    development	    process	    has	    been	    described	    in	    section	   5.6.	   6.2	   Evaluation	   Through	   Static	   and	   Dynamic	   Analysis	   The	    evaluation	    process	    was	    carried	    out	    through	    focus	    group	    interviews,	   workshops	   and	   meetings	   with	   research	   participants.	   The	   information	   regarding	   the	    feedback	    process,	    including	    participant	    details,	    dates	    of	    workshops	    and	   meetings,	   and	   transcript/notes	   can	   be	   found	   in	   Appendix	   A.	   As	    mentioned	    in	    Section	    5.6,	    there	    were	    three	    major	    iterations	    in	    the	   development	    process,	    and	    frequent	    small	    iterations	    that	    took	    place	    during	    the	   development	    of	    the	    VisiLean	    prototype.	    The	    evaluation	    process	    started	    quite	   early,	   and	   contributed	   to	   the	   development	   of	   prototype	   throughout	   the	   process.	   However,	    for	    the	    sake	    of	    clarity	    this	    evaluation	    section	    is	    also	    divided	    to	   correspond	   to	   the	   three	   major	   iterations	   as	   described	   in	   Section	   5.10	   and	   shown	   in	   Figure	   42.	   Here	   it	   should	   be	   noted	   that	   some	   features	   evaluated	   during	   each	   iteration	    were	    implemented	    within	    the	    same	    development	    cycle,	    while	    others	   were	    either	    implemented	    in	    the	    next	    development	    cycle	    (iteration)	    or	    left	   unimplemented,	   to	   be	   dealt	   with	   future	   development.	   As	    the	    VisiLean	    prototype	    developed	    further,	    the	    number	    and	    complexity	    of	   features	   increased,	   however	   the	   evaluation	   has	   been	   divided	   against	   three	   major	   criteria/system	   functions,	   namely:	   • User	   interface	   • Production	   planning	   and	   control	   • Product	   and	   process	   integration	   6.2.1	   Iteration	   1	   The	    main	    goal	    of	    evaluation	    during	    the	    first	    iteration	    of	    the	    prototype	    was	    to	   validate	    the	    user	    interface	    and	    the	    main	    process	    for	    production	    planning	    and	   how	    the	    BIM	    model	    navigation	    will	    be	    implemented	    conceptually.	    As	    the	   prototype	    development	    had	    not	    advanced	    to	    a	    very	    functional	    or	    visual	    stage,	   this	    evaluation	    involved	    mainly	    internal	    participants	    (from	    Salford	    Centre	    for	   Research	   and	   Innovation)	   and	   some	   external	   participants	   who	   were	   experienced	   with	   production	   planning	   and	   BIM	   use	   on	   construction	   projects.	   Three	   internal	   research	   workshops	   were	   organised	   to	   carry	   out	   evaluation	   and	   two	   meetings	   with	   external	   participants	   were	   carried	   out.	   6.2.1.1	   User	   Interface	   At	    this	    stage,	    none	    of	    the	    actual	    functions	    had	    been	    operational	    and	    only	    an	   application	    shell	    was	    presented	    to	    the	    participants.	    The	    goal	    was	    to	    get	    user	   feedback	    on	    the	    overall	    user	    interface	    design,	    including	    features	    such	    as	   placement	    of	    panels,	    planning	    interface,	    type	    of	    navigation	    between	    different	   parts	   of	   application	   and	   overall	   input/output	   during	   operation.	   The	   users	   were	   presented	   with	   two	   main	   options;	   first	   option	   had	   two	   separate	   windows,	    one	    for	    production	    planning	    and	    another	    for	    BIM.	    While	    the	    second	   option	   had	   both	   interfaces	   integrated	   in	   the	   same	   application	   window	   that	   were	   positioned	   alongside	   each	   other,	   with	   production	   planning	   on	   the	   left	   side	   and	   BIM	   model	   on	   the	   right.	   The	   users	   opted	   for	   the	   second	   option	   with	   an	   integrated	   design,	   which	   enabled	   process	   and	   product	   visualisation	   from	   the	   same	   window.	   This	   decision	   was	   unanimous	   from	   all	   participants,	   as	   users	   wanted	   the	   facility	   to	    view	    both	    process	    and	    product	    visualisations	    without	    having	    to	    switch	   windows.	    The	    participants	    also	    requested	    flexibility	    while	    choosing	    the	   integrated	   option	   so	   that	   the	   size	   of	   either	   panel	   could	   be	   adjusted	   to	   suit	   the	   nature	   of	   the	   BIM	   model	   and	   resolution	   of	   viewing	   screen.	   In	    terms	    of	    other	    general	    user	    interface	    options,	    no	    major	    changes	    were	   requested,	   and	   the	   master-­‐detail	   interface	   (where	   the	   details	   of	   any	   selected	   item	   would	   be	   displayed	   at	   the	   bottom	   of	   the	   screen),	   tabbed	   interface	   for	   planning	   workflow	   and	   general	   button	   layout	   were	   accepted	   as	   it	   is.	   6.2.1.2	   Production	   Planning	   At	    this	    stage,	    the	    planning	    interface	    itself	    was	    not	    implemented	    but	    was	   presented	    in	    form	    of	    a	    process	    description,	    and	    a	    top-­‐level	    process	    workflow	   diagram.	   Also,	   feedback	   regarding	   external	   planning	   and	   scheduling	   systems	   that	   the	    potential	    users	    would	    like	    to	    integrate	    with	    was	    sought.	    Here,	    the	    users	   preferred	    the	    freedom	    to	    create	    tasks	    directly	    in	    VisiLean	    as	    well	    as	    the	   possibility	    of	    importing	    an	    existing	    plan	    from	    major	    planning	    and	    scheduling	   systems.	    Also,	    the	    users	    indicated	    that	    in	    most	    cases	    the	    production	    team	    will	   receive	    a	    master	    plan	    that	    has	    already	    been	    developed	    so	    that	    would	    be	    the	   natural	   starting	   point	   for	   the	   workflow.	   An	    activity	    breakdown	    structure	    having	    three	    levels;	    i.e.	    a	    phase,	    a	    task	    and	    a	   subtask	    were	    presented.	    The	    phase	    level	    would	    represent	    normally	    a	    work	   package	   (to	   be	   used	   during	   reverse	   phase	   scheduling),	   a	   task	   would	   represent	   a	   typical	   work	   activity	   at	   the	   look-­‐ahead	   plan	   level	   and	   a	   subtask	   representing	   an	   activity	    that	    is	    further	    broken	    in	    sub-­‐activities	    of	    manageable	    size	    that	    can	    be	   allocated	   to	   a	   worker	   or	   a	   team	   during	   a	   weekly	   execution	   plan.	   6.2.1.3	   Product	   and	   Process	   Integration	   Similarly	    to	    the	    planning	    process,	    in	    the	    first	    iteration,	    none	    of	    the	    actual	   integration	    features	    had	    been	    present.	    There	    was	    a	    provision	    to	    import	    the	   model,	    however,	    no	    navigation,	    filtering	    or	    integration	    features	    had	    been	   implemented.	    At	    this	    stage,	    the	    users	    were	    asked	    to	    suggest	    what	    navigation	   features	    they	    would	    find	    useful,	    and	    also	    how	    they	    would	    like	    the	    product-­process	    integration	    to	    function	    (i.e.	    how	    to	    link	    tasks	    to	    the	    model	    elements,	   what	   information	   they	   would	   like	   to	   see	   on	   the	   model,	   etc.).	    	   The	    users	    also	    provided	    feedback	    regarding	    the	    selection	    and	    filtering	    of	   elements	   in	   the	   BIM	   model	   so	   that	   the	   linking	   of	   tasks	   to	   elements	   is	   made	   more	   efficient.	    Essentially,	    the	    feedback	    received	    indicated	    that	    the	    system	    should	   provide	   a	   “tree”	   of	   element	   in	   a	   hierarchical	   structure	   to	   help	   with	   the	   selection.	   6.2.2	   Iteration	   2	   The	   second	   iteration	   was	   one	   of	   the	   intensive	   processes	   of	   development	   as	   most	   features	    were	    implemented	    during	    this	    iteration.	    Numerous	    demonstrations,	   workshops	    and	    meetings	    with	    focus	    groups	    were	    organised,	    and	    the	    project	   development	   team	   met	   frequently	   during	   this	   period.	    	   6.2.2.1	   User	   Interface	   During	    the	    second	    iteration,	    the	    main	    features	    of	    the	    planning	    interface	    were	   implemented	    and	    evaluated.	    The	    main	    tabbed	    interface	    of	    the	    planning	   application,	   the	   general	   administration	   module	   and	   also	   the	   BIM	   model	   window	   along	    with	    its	    element	    filtering	    and	    selection	    tree	    and	    navigation	    tools	    were	   developed	   during	   this	   period.	   The	    feedback	    regarding	    the	    tabbed	    interface	    was	    positive,	    and	    no	    change	   requests	    were	    received.	    The	    master	    detail	    interface	    was	    also	    generally	    well	   accepted.	    The	    use	    of	    colour	    coding	    to	    indicate	    the	    status	    of	    tasks	    and	    its	   synchronisation	    with	    BIM	    elements	    was	    also	    received	    positively	    during	   evaluations.	    	   6.2.2.2	   Production	   Planning	   The	    production-­‐planning	    feature	    in	    second	    iteration	    included	    the	    complete	   planning	    workflow	    with	    the	    Phase	    Planning,	    look-­‐ahead	    planning	    and	    weekly	   planning	    modules.	    The	    constraints	    definition	    and	    management	    features	    were	   also	   demonstrated.	   The	   overall	   feedback	   from	   the	   participants	   was	   positive,	   where	   the	   participants	   reported	    that	    they	    were	    satisfied	    with	    the	    planning	    workflow	    that	    the	    system	   presented.	    The	    constraints	    management	    capabilities	    of	    the	    system	    were	    also	   reported	   to	   be	   very	   useful	   during	   the	   planning	   sessions.	   However,	   there	   were	   a	   number	   of	   issues,	   which	   needed	   attention	   that	   were	   highlighted	   by	   the	   users.	    	   First	   of	   all,	   the	   issue	   of	   resource	   management	   was	   highlighted	   during	   evaluation.	   In	   the	   second	   iteration,	   there	   was	   no	   distinction	   made	   between	   consumable	   and	   non-­‐consumable	   resources.	   In	   order	   to	   create	   a	   constraint,	   or	   in	   other	   words	   to	   allocate	    resources	    to	    tasks,	    each	    resource	    constraint	    had	    to	    be	    individually	   created	   in	   the	   Project	   Administration	   section.	   For	   example	   it	   was	   not	   possible	   to	   create	    a	    material	    resource	    type	    called	    Bricks	    where	    out	    of	    total	    5000	    bricks	   received	    on	    site,	    2500	    could	    be	    allocated	    to	    two	    tasks.	    Instead,	    two	    separate	   resource	   instances	   would	   need	   to	   be	   created	   each	   for	   2500	   bricks	   and	   allocated	   to	    each	    constraints.	    The	    participants	    found	    this	    aspect	    cumbersome	    and	   inefficient.	   Also,	   due	   to	   the	   distinction	   not	   being	   made	   between	   consumable	   and	   non-­‐consumable	    resource,	    it	    was	    difficult	    to	    manage	    resources	    such	    as	    teams	   and	   equipment,	   especially	   when	   there	   are	   tasks	   competing	   for	   them.	   Participants	   indicated	    that	    they	    would	    like	    to	    see	    clashes	    between	    resource	    allocation	   highlighted	   in	   the	   system,	   where	   if	   a	   resource	   has	   been	   booked	   multiple	   times	   at	   the	   same	   time,	   the	   system	   would	   alert	   the	   user	   to	   correct	   the	   situation.	   The	   second	   issue	   highlighted	   during	   the	   evaluation	   of	   second	   prototype	   was	   that	   of	   task	   hierarchies.	   In	   the	   first	   iteration	   a	   three	   level	   hierarchy	   of	   plan	   activities,	   where	    activities	    were	    divided	    into	    Phase,	    Task	    and	    Subtask	    was	    proposed.	   However,	   during	   the	   evaluation	   of	   the	   planning	   workflow,	   it	   emerged	   that	   there	   could	   be	   instances	   where	   plan	   activities	   at	   the	   subtask	   level	   need	   to	   be	   divided	   further	   into	   smaller	   chunks.	   This	   was	   due	   to	   the	   fact	   that	   many	   planned	   activities	   at	   the	   subtask	   level	   were	   too	   large	   to	   be	   allocated	   to	   a	   team	   or	   individual	   to	   be	   managed	   at	   the	   look-­‐ahead	   or	   weekly	   level;	   were	   longer	   than	   a	   week	   (so	   they	   could	   not	   fit	   into	   the	   weekly	   plan)	   or	   they	   were	   not	   at	   a	   suitable	   level	   to	   be	   linked	   to	   a	   BIM	   element.	    	   The	    third	    issue	    was	    regarding	    the	    organisation	    hierarchy.	    Similar	    to	    the	    task	   hierarchical	    structure,	    the	    first	    iteration	    proposed	    a	    two	    level	    organisational	   hierarchy,	    where	    tasks	    could	    either	    be	    allocated	    to	    an	    organisation	    or	    an	   individual.	   However,	   during	   the	   evaluation	   process,	   the	   participants	   highlighted	   the	    need	    to	    allocate	    tasks	    to	    a	    team,	    which	    would	    consist	    of	    a	    group	    of	   individuals	   either	   from	   one	   or	   different	   organisations.	   6.2.2.3	   Process	   and	   Product	   Integration	   The	    main	    change	    request	    during	    this	    evaluation	    was	    for	    more	    graphical	   information	    to	    be	    provided	    in	    the	    task	    window	    that	    was	    overlaid	    on	    BIM	   elements.	    There	    was	    a	    call	    to	    include	    more	    information	    such	    as	    visual	   information	    about	    the	    current	    status	    of	    the	    task,	    and	    the	    constraints	    that	    are	   associated	   with	   each	   task.	   The	   participants	   also	   indicated	   that	   they	   would	   like	   to	   manage	    constraints	    directly	    from	    this	    status	    window	    (i.e.	    to	    mark	    them	    as	   available),	   which	   should	   be	   in	   synchronisation	   with	   the	   planning	   interface.	   The	   aspect	   of	   task	   hierarchies	   and	   the	   level	   of	   planning	   also	   affects	   the	   level	   of	   detail	    required	    from	    the	    BIM	    model	    in	    order	    to	    support	    product	    and	    process	   integration.	   For	   example,	   if	   a	   model	   is	   not	   sufficiently	   detailed,	   the	   team	   would	   not	   be	   able	   to	   link	   tasks	   at	   a	   lower	   level	   (i.e.	   weekly	   or	   daily)	   to	   BIM	   elements.	   However,	   this	   particular	   aspect	   is	   outside	   the	   scope	   of	   this	   research,	   and	   possibly	   even	   future	   implementation	   of	   VisiLean	   application	   in	   the	   field	   as	   in	   most	   cases	   the	    model	    would	    have	    already	    been	    developed.	    Hence,	    this	    aspect	    is	    covered	   through	    a	    set	    of	    recommended	    practice	    to	    designers	    in	    order	    to	    implement	    a	   Lean	    and	    BIM	    production	    management	    system	    on	    a	    construction	    project.	    This	   issue	    of	    level	    of	    detail	    required	    from	    the	    model(s)	    is	    also	    covered	    in	    the	    pilot	   project	   implementation.	   6.2.3	   Iteration	   3	   The	    third	    and	    final	    iteration	    (in	    the	    scope	    of	    the	    research	    project)	    mainly	   focussed	    on	    refinement	    and	    fine-­‐tuning	    of	    features	    based	    on	    the	    evaluation	   during	   second	   and	   third	   iteration	   and	   also	   through	   the	   pilot	   project.	   Also,	   during	   this	    final	    phase	    of	    feedback,	    the	    users	    were	    encouraged	    to	    think	    beyond	    the	   prototype	   implementation	   and	   suggest	   features	   they	   would	   like	   to	   see	   in	   future	   implementations.	    For	    example,	    if	    they	    would	    like	    to	    see	    a	    touch	    enabled	   interface,	   development	   of	   a	   mobile	   interface	   to	   extend	   the	   use	   of	   the	   system	   in	   the	   field,	   etc.	   A	   number	   of	   features	   identified	   through	   this	   evaluation	   could	   not	   be	   implemented	   due	   to	   lack	   of	   resources	   and	   time;	   they	   have	   been	   covered	   in	   Section	   5.8.	   6.2.3.1	   User	   Interface	   The	   first	   two	   iterations	   included	   panning,	   zooming	   and	   rotating	   features	   to	   help	   with	   the	   navigation	   of	   the	   model.	   During	   the	   third	   iteration,	   the	   users	   pointed	   out	   that	   having	   the	   facility	   to	   “walk”	   or	   “fly”	   around	   the	   model	   would	   make	   the	   navigation	   more	   efficient.	   Also,	   having	   these	   features	   will	   facilitate	   a	   better	   user	   experience	    if	    the	    system	    is	    implemented	    using	    a	    touch	    screen	    (as	    in	    the	    pilot	   implementation).	    	   Separately,	   the	   users	   indicated	   that	   extending	   the	   core	   system	   through	   mobile	   applications	   that	   can	   be	   used	   from	   handheld	   devices	   such	   as	   Smart	   Phones	   and	   Tablet	   computers,	   will	   improve	   the	   overall	   usability	   of	   the	   system	   and	   help	   keep	   the	   system	   updated	   frequently.	    	   6.2.3.2	   Production	   Planning	   One	   of	   the	   key	   requirements	   to	   emerge	   during	   evaluation	   at	   this	   stage	   was	   about	   booking	    of	    non-­‐consumable	    resources	    such	    as	    specialist	    teams	    and	    equipment	   (such	    as	    crane,	    fork-­‐lifts,	    etc.).	    Users	    pointed	    out	    that	    one	    of	    the	    biggest	   contributing	    factors	    for	    the	    delay	    on	    construction	    sites	    is	    multiple	   booking/allocation	   of	   a	   particular	   resource.	   Specialist	   equipment	   such	   as	   Cranes	   are	   normally	   booked	   by	   the	   hour	   to	   particular	   tasks.	   Similarly	   when	   the	   site	   is	   congested	    or	    located	    on	    different	    levels,	    space	    needed	    for	    construction	   operations	   could	   also	   be	   a	   critical	   constraint	   and	   should	   be	   booked	   in	   advance	   to	   reduce	    clashes	    during	    execution.	    As	    a	    result,	    a	    booking	    system	    was	   recommended	   for	   such	   resources.	    	   Also,	    to	    minimise	    clashes	    between	    competing	    tasks,	    whenever	    a	    resource	    was	   allocated	    to	    multiple	    tasks	    the	    system	    prompts	    the	    user	    and	    also	    displays	    a	   graphical	    symbol	    next	    to	    the	    task	    (in	    both	    planning	    and	    BIM	    window)	    so	    that	   such	   clashes	   can	   be	   dealt	   with	   swiftly.	   During	   the	   first	   two	   iterations	   of	   VisiLean,	   the	   users	   had	   to	   first	   create	   a	   plan	   and	   then	   manually	   select	   the	   tasks	   from	   a	   look-­‐ahead	   or	   a	   weekly	   planning	   window,	   which	    would	    then	    be	    added	    to	    the	    respective	    plan.	    Users	    indicated	    that	    this	   process	    added	    unnecessary	    steps	    and	    requested	    automatic	    creation	    of	    a	    look-­ahead	   and	   weekly	   plan	   based	   on	   the	   date	   (and	   a	   look-­‐ahead	   window	   in	   case	   of	   creating	   a	   look-­‐ahead	   plan).	   In	   the	   case	   of	   the	   look-­‐ahead	   plan,	   the	   system	   should	   automatically	   populate	   the	   plan	   with	   all	   the	   tasks	   scheduled	   between	   those	   dates.	   During	   the	   collaborative	   sessions,	    those	    tasks,	    which	    cannot	    be	    “made-­‐ready”	    within	    the	    look-­‐ahead	   window,	   would	   be	   removed	   from	   the	   plan.	   Similarly,	   the	   weekly	   plan	   should	   be	   populated	   automatically	   of	   all	   the	   tasks,	   which	   are	   free	   of	   constraints.	    	   6.2.3.3	   Process	   and	   Product	   Integration	   The	   first	   two	   iterations	   of	   the	   software	   had	   one-­‐to-­‐one	   mapping	   between	   tasks	   and	    BIM	    elements.	    Hence	    it	    was	    not	    possible	    to	    select	    multiple	    tasks,	    which	   would	    be	    highlighted	    on	    the	    BIM	    window.	    This	    somewhat	    limited	    the	   functionality	   to	   carry	   out	   constructability	   review	   and	   visualise	   the	   sequencing.	   This	    issue	    was	    highlighted	    by	    the	    users,	    and	    the	    possibility	    of	    multiple	    task	   visualisation	   on	   BIM	   window	   was	   requested.	    	   Also	    connected	    to	    this	    feature,	    was	    the	    possibility	    to	    carry	    out	    4D	    reviews	    of	   look-­‐ahead	    and	    weekly	    planning	    schedule,	    or	    for	    any	    selected	    tasks	    was	    also	   requested.	   This	   feature	   would	   enable	   a	   4D	   style	   animation	   of	   selected	   tasks	   to	   help	    understand	    the	    sequence	    of	    tasks	    and	    at	    the	    same	    time	    visualise	    their	   current	   status	   (i.e.	   ready,	   non-­‐ready,	   in	   progress,	   etc.).	   Task	   creation	   in	   first	   two	   iterations	   was	   made	   possible	   either	   via	   importing	   an	   external	    plan,	    or	    creating	    tasks	    within	    VisiLean	    planning	    window.	    However,	    a	   new	   feature	   was	   requested,	   whereby	   a	   user	   would	   be	   able	   to	   create	   a	   task	   by	   selecting	   a	   BIM	   element.	    	   6.2.3.4	   Reporting	   As	   the	   core	   system	   features	   were	   still	   being	   developed,	   the	   first	   two	   iterations	   of	   the	    software	    did	    not	    implement	    any	    reporting	    features.	    However,	    in	    the	    third	   iteration	    some	    basic	    reporting	    features	    were	    implemented.	    These	    reports	   enabled	   generating	   a	   PPC,	   reasons	   for	   non-­‐completion	   and	   a	   task-­‐list	   ordered	   by	   a	   subcontractor	   or	   a	   data-­‐range	   automatically	   from	   the	   system.	   PPC	   and	   reasons	   for	    non-­‐completion	    are	    two	    of	    the	    core	    lean	    reports	    and	    enables	    continuous	   process	   improvement.	   As	    VisiLean	    captured	    a	    significant	    range	    of	    current	    production	    data,	    the	    users	   requested	   a	   dashboard	   interface	   where	   real-­‐time	   information	   about	   production	   can	   be	   graphically	   displayed	   to	   enable	   project	   managers	   and	   other	   stakeholders	   respond	   to	   the	   progress	   and	   take	   necessary	   actions	   appropriately.	    	   A3s	   reports	   are	   also	   very	   important	   features	   in	   lean	   production,	   as	   they	   enable	   efficient	   problem	   solving	   in	   the	   field.	   Users	   also	   requested	   automatic	   generation	   of	    an	    A3	    report	    that	    could	    be	    customised	    by	    the	    project	    manager	    to	    display	   various	    production	    related	    information,	    including	    PPC,	    reasons	    for	    non-­completion,	   performance	   of	   constraints	   analysis,	   etc.	   6.3	   Pilot	   Project	   In	    design	    science,	    one	    of	    the	    highly	    rated	    methods	    for	    evaluation	    is	    direct	   implementation	    of	    the	    newly	    constructed	    artefact	    in	    a	    real-­‐life	    commercial	   environment	   such	   as	   the	   case	   study	   or	   field	   study	   method	   as	   mentioned	   in	   Table	   29	    by	    Hevner	    (2004).	    Due	    to	    on-­‐going	    collaboration	    with	    a	    number	    of	   construction	    organisations	    and	    clients,	    it	    was	    possible	    to	    organise	    a	    trial	   implementation/demonstration	    of	    VisiLean,	    where	    real	    project	    data	    was	   imported	   and	   simulated	   and	   demonstrated	   to	   the	   project	   team	   to	   receive	   their	   feedback.	    As	    such	    the	    pilot	    project	    did	    not	    involve	    actual	    use	    of	    the	    system	   during	   collaborative	   planning	   sessions,	   but	   involved	   detailed	   demonstration	   of	   VisiLean	    using	    actual	    project	    planning	    and	    BIM	    information.	    The	    pilot	    project	   was	    commissioned	    by	    the	    client	    organisation,	    however	    the	    main	    stakeholders	   during	   the	   execution	   were	   the	   main	   contractor	   and	   the	   design	   organisation.	   In	   particular	   the	   following	   individuals	   took	   part	   in	   the	   trial:	   Main	   contractor:	    i. Group	   Business	   Improvement	   Manager	    ii. Project	   Manager	   iii. 	Lean	   Project	   Planner	   iv. 	Project	   supervisor	   (Ductwork)	   v. 	BIM	   Manager	   Designer:	   i. Managing	   consultant	   ii. Chief	   Engineer	   iii. Senior	   Group	   Engineer	   (Design,	   BIM	   support)	   The	   main	   selection	   criteria	   applied	   while	   selecting	   a	   pilot	   project	   are	   described	   below.	   i. Following	    collaborative	    planning	    process:	    As	    VisiLean	    supports	    the	   Last	   Planner	   System™	   of	   production	   planning	   and	   control,	   it	   was	   thought	   necessary	    that	    the	    selected	    project	    should	    also	    be	    following	    a	   collaborative	   planning	   process.	   Due	   to	   the	   short	   time	   scales	   involved,	   and	   limited	    resources,	    training	    the	    project	    team	    on	    collaborative	    planning	   practices	    if	    they	    are	    not	    already	    following	    them	    was	    thought	    to	    be	    a	   difficult	    aspect.	    It	    helped	    significantly	    that	    the	    client	    organisation	    (who	   sponsored	    the	    project)	    had	    mandated	    the	    use	    of	    collaborative	    planning	   processes	   on	   all	   their	   new	   projects,	   and	   had	   already	   trained	   their	   first	   tier	   supply	    chain.	    Also,	    the	    main	    contractor	    on	    the	    project	    was	    also	    quite	   familiar	   with	   the	   lean	   collaborative	   planning	   and	   had	   been	   implementing	   them	   on	   many	   of	   their	   projects	   for	   at	   least	   past	   five	   years.	    	   ii. BIM	    model	    availability:	    VisiLean	    integrates	    the	    BIM	    model	    with	    the	   production	    planning	    process;	    hence	    a	    model	    of	    the	    project	    was	    a	   requirement.	   This	   aspect	   was	   challenging	   as	   the	   client	   was	   the	   Highways	   Agency	    in	    the	    UK,	    and	    BIM	    was	    not	    yet	    very	    commonplace	    in	    the	   infrastructure	    sector.	    Only	    the	    major	    schemes	    would	    have	    a	    3D	    model,	   and	   even	   then	   it	   was	   not	   certain	   that	   the	   model	   available	   would	   be	   fully	   parametric.	   However,	   a	   scheme	   was	   identified	   that	   had	   a	   model	   available	   which	    had	    partial	    parametric	    capability.	    Further	    details	    regarding	    the	   model	   are	   found	   below.	   The	   following	   section	   describes	   the	   project	   and	   the	   implementation	   process	   in	   detail.	   6.3.1	   Project	   Specifics	   6.3.1.1	   General	   Project	   Details	   The	   main	   project	   was	   to	   install	   automated	   traffic	   control	   gantries	   on	   a	   major	   UK	   motorway.	    The	    client	    was	    the	    UK’s	    Highways	    Agency,	    and	    the	    total	    project	   duration	    (as	    planned,	    starting	    from	    January	    2012)	    was	    approximately	    26	   months.	    	   The	   main	   purpose	   of	   this	   project	   was	   to	   reduce	   congestion	   and	   improve	   the	   flow	   of	   traffic,	   especially	   during	   the	   peak	   hours.	   This	   would	   be	   achieved	   by	   imposing	   variable	   mandatory	   speed	   limits	   and	   allow	   the	   use	   of	   hard	   shoulder	   (emergency	   lane	   at	   the	   side	   of	   the	   motorway)	   as	   an	   extra	   traffic	   lane.	   The	   variable	   speed	   limit	   imposed	   will	   be	   displayed	   on	   the	   newly	   installed	   gantries,	   which	   will	   also	   house	   automated	    speed	    cameras	    to	    enforce	    the	    limit.	    Figure	    43	    shows	    how	    the	   managed	    motorway	    system	    works	    in	    its	    entirety.	    According	    to	    the	    Highways	   Agency	   the	   main	   benefits	   of	   this	   system	   are:	   • Additional	   capacity	   for	   vehicles	   • Improving	   the	   detection	   of	   incidents	   • Improving	   the	   response	   to	   incidents	   • Helping	   to	   alleviate	   congestion	   • Reducing	   delays	   caused	   by	   incidents	   or	   congestion	   • Piloting	   new	   and	   innovative	   concepts	   • Targeted	   solutions	   to	   specific	   problems	   	   Figure	   43.	   Managed	   Motorway	   System	   (Courtesy	   of	   Highways	   Agency,	   UK).	   6.3.1.2	   Stage	   of	   the	   Project	   When	    the	    implementation	    started,	    almost	    80%	    of	    the	    project	    scope	    was	   complete.	    The	    main	    activity	    that	    was	    left	    to	    complete	    was	    cable	    ducting	    and	   installation.	   Hence,	   these	   activities	   were	   the	   main	   focus	   of	   the	   pilot	   project,	   and	   only	    the	    tasks	    related	    to	    ducting	    and	    cable	    installation	    were	    focussed	    upon	   during	   the	   implementation.	   6.3.1.3	   Existing	   Systems	   Being	   Used	   Lean	   Process/Production	   Management:	    As	   mentioned	   above,	   the	   project	   was	   already	    following	    the	    collaborative	    planning	    process.	    The	    look-­‐ahead	    window	   was	   2	   weeks	   long,	   and	   the	   project	   team	   also	   met	   every	   week	   for	   the	   commitment	   planning	   session.	   There	   was	   also	   a	   “daily	   huddle”	   at	   the	   end	   of	   the	   day	   to	   discuss	   the	   progress	   (for	   that	   day)	   and	   also	   to	   discuss	   the	   next	   day’s	   tasks.	   There	   was	   however	    one	    variation,	    during	    the	    look-­‐ahead	    planning	    meetings,	    instead	    of	   doing	    a	    detailed	    constraints	    analysis,	    the	    site	    manager	    delegated	    the	   responsibility	   of	   removing	   the	   constraints	   analysis	   to	   each	   team.	   This	   followed	   on	   with	   the	   assumption	   that	   if	   the	   team	   leader	   commits	   to	   a	   task,	   the	   constrains	   have	   been	   (or	   will	   be)	   removed	   in	   due	   time.	   The	    project	    used	    a	    shared	    meeting	    space	    to	    organise	    collaborative	    meetings,	   where	   progress	   charts	   were	   also	   displayed,	   along	   with	   the	   PPC	   and	   a	   “Concern	   and	   Countermeasure”	   board.	   The	   “Concern	   and	   Countermeasure”	   board	   can	   be	   likened	   with	   the	   constraints	   removal	   process;	   here	   each	   concern	   (i.e.	   constraint)	   related	    to	    the	    project	    was	    listed	    along	    with	    the	    responsible	    person	    to	    remove	   that	    constraint	    and	    the	    status	    (i.e.	    whether	    it	    has	    been	    removed	    or	    not).	    This	   room	    also	    hosted	    a	    number	    of	    large-­‐scale	    drawings	    with	    visual	    tracking	    of	   activities	    (colour	    coded	    to	    demonstrate	    completed,	    on-­‐going	    and	    future	   activities).	    	   The	   team	   used	   Primavera	   Project	   Planner	   as	   the	   chosen	   project	   planning	   tool	   to	   carry	    out	    master	    planning	    activity.	    For	    collaborative	    planning,	    Microsoft	    Excel	   was	    used,	    where	    each	    task	    manager	    had	    developed	    his	    or	    her	    own	    project	   planning	    worksheet.	    Bentley	    ProjectWise	    was	    used	    as	    a	    project	    information	   management	    system	    (project	    extranet),	    which	    stored	    relevant	    project	   information	   and	   also	   provided	   shared	   access	   to	   the	   project	   team.	   BIM	    Model:	    The	   project	   had	   been	   designed	   using	   Bentley	   MXROAD,	   which	   is	   a	   software	    for	    road	    design.	    Although	    it	    is	    a	    capable	    road	    design	    software	    that	   enables	   3D	   model	   creation,	   it	   is	   however	   a	   string	   based	   design	   software,	   which	   does	   not	   allow	   for	   creation	   of	   parametric	   objects.	   As	   a	   result,	   the	   designer	   used	   a	   special	   software	   process	   to	   export	   the	   model	   in	   VRML	   that	   created	   solid	   objects	   from	    strings,	    and	    then	    added	    parametric	    information	    manually.	    This	    however,	   posed	   a	   challenge	   in	   terms	   of	   the	   pilot	   implementation,	   as	   VisiLean	   relies	   on	   the	   parametric	   objects	   in	   the	   model	   in	   order	   for	   them	   to	   be	   linked	   to	   the	   tasks	   in	   the	   planning	    window.	    Hence,	    the	    model	    had	    to	    be	    modified	    accordingly	    so	    that	    it	   included	   identification	   information	   for	   individual	   objects.	    	   Also,	    as	    the	    model	    was	    exported	    in	    VRML	    format	    and	    then	    imported	    in	   Navisworks,	   the	   hierarchy	   of	   model	   objects	   was	   not	   very	   clearly	   present	   in	   the	   model.	   The	   VisiLean	   system	   depends	   on	   this	   object	   hierarchy	   to	   build	   a	   tree	   of	   elements	   that	   helps	   in	   selection	   of	   objects,	   which	   can	   be	   easily	   linked	   to	   tasks.	   Due	   to	   this	   lack	   of	   hierarchy,	   a	   custom	   object	   tree	   had	   to	   be	   created	   in	   VisiLean.	   The	    collaborative	    planning	    meeting	    space	    also	    housed	    a	    large	    screen	    (72”)	   SmartBoard	    that	    was	    connected	    with	    a	    laptop	    computer	    running	    Autodesk	   Navisworks	    2012.	    This	    SmartBoard	    also	    offered	    touch	    capability,	    which	    were	   useful	   in	   navigating	   the	   model	   by	   using	   either	   the	   fingers	   or	   the	   SmartBoard	   pen.	   6.3.2	   Scope	   of	   the	   Pilot	   Due	   to	   resource	   constraints	   and	   time	   limitation,	   the	   overall	   duration	   of	   the	   pilot	   project	    was	    3	    months.	    However,	    only	    two	    months	    were	    available	    for	    actual	   implementation	    due	    to	    planned	    and	    public	    holidays,	    and	    also	    due	    to	    the	    desk	   based	   research	   and	   preparation	   work	   involved.	   When	   the	   pilot	   project	   started	   80%	    of	    the	    construction	    work	    had	    been	    completed	    and	    only	    ducting	    and	   communication	    installation	    activities	    were	    remaining.	    Hence	    the	    pilot	    project	   focussed	   on	   implementation	   of	   these	   activities.	   The	   following	   project	   processes	   were	   within	   the	   scope	   of	   the	   pilot.	   i. Modifying	   the	   BIM	   model	   ii.

Receiving	    feedback	    from	    users,	    identifying	    what	    worked	    and	    lessons	   learnt	   viii. Identifying	   model	   requirements	   for	   future	   implementation	   of	   VisiLean	   The	   main	   objective	   of	   the	   pilot	   was	   to	   receive	   feedback	   from	   those	   involved	   in	   the	   planning	   session	   on	   VisiLean	   to	   validate	   the	   prototype.	   In	   parallel,	   it	   was	   also	   important	   to	   identify	   what	   are	   the	   other	   requirements,	   i.e.	   from	   process,	   training	   and	    technology	    perspective	    that	    have	    to	    be	    met	    in	    order	    to	    implement	    a	   production	   planning	   tool	   such	   as	   VisiLean.	   The	   following	   section	   describes	   the	   pilot	   implementation	   process	   in	   more	   detail.	   6.3.3	   Implementation	   Process	   The	   implementation	   process	   consisted	   of	   three	   main	   stages	   as	   mentioned	   below,	   namely,	    preparation,	    implementation	    and	    feedback	    gathering.	    As	    mentioned	   above,	   due	   to	   VisiLean	   being	   research	   software	   and	   in	   the	   prototype	   stage,	   it	   was	   not	   possible	   to	   use	   it	   during	   actual	   collaborative	   planning	   sessions,	   as	   it	   would	   increase	    the	    risk	    to	    the	    project.	    However,	    a	    trial	    implementation,	    which	   incorporated	   the	   actual	   project	   BIM	   model	   and	   collaborative	   plans	   of	   the	   “duct	   installation”	    activity	    was	    organised.	   Also,	    collaborative	    planning	    sessions	    were	   simulated	   within	   the	   system,	   including	   look-­‐ahead	   and	   weekly	   plans,	   constraints	   analysis	    and	    management,	    task	    management	    (including	    starting,	    stopping	    and	   completing	    tasks),	    and	    some	    reporting	    functions.	    The	    feedback	    was	    gathered	   during	    each	    demonstration	    sessions,	    which	    was	    taken	    into	    account	    partially	   during	    the	    development	    process	    (as	    outlined	    in	    three	    iterations)	    and	    the	   features,	    which	    could	    not	    be	    implemented	    were	    documented	    for	    future	   development.	   6.3.3.1	   Preparation	   In	   order	   for	   the	   VisiLean	   software	   to	   support	   the	   collaborative	   planning	   process	   for	    the	    pilot	    project,	    some	    modifications	    were	    required.	    Previous	    to	    the	    trial,	   VisiLean	    had	    predominantly	    been	    tested	    to	    display	    and	    manipulate	    building	   models,	   which	   are	   relatively	   compact	   and	   easily	   navigable.	   The	   trial	   project	   by	   contrast	   was	   spread	   over	   a	   large	   area,	   and	   consequently	   the	   associated	   model	   is	   commensurately	   large	   in	   dimension.	   Given	   the	   extensive	   and	   linear	   nature	   of	   this	   model	    it	    became	    necessary	    to	    implement	    a	    zoom	    feature	    that	    aligned	    the	   viewpoint	   direction	   and	   scale	   with	   a	   specified	   model	   element.	   This	   allowed	   for	   rapid	   focus	   on	   model	   elements	   pertinent	   to	   a	   given	   task	   without	   the	   necessity	   for	   extensive	   panning	   and	   zooming	   which	   can	   easily	   result	   in	   losing	   ones	   bearings	   in	   the	   model	   'space'.	   Another	   significant	   issue	   with	   the	   model	   for	   the	   trial	   project	   was	   the	   lack	   of	   a	   natural	   candidate	   for	   model	   element	   'identity'	   in	   technical	   terms.	   Resolving	   this	   issue,	   involved	   work	   on	   the	   part	   of	   both	   the	   VisiLean	   team	   and	   the	   project's	   BIM	   modeller	    (who	    belonged	    to	    the	    Design	    organisation).	    Firstly,	    the	    modeller	   assigned	   a	   unique	   label	   to	   model	   elements	   that	   were	   of	   interest	   (in	   this	   case	   the	   ducting	    and	    communication	    equipment),	    aggregating	    a	    number	    of	    geometric	   entities	    into	    a	    pseudo	    'object'	    analogous	    to	    the	    type	    one	    might	    expect	    to	    have	   access	   to	   in	   a	   building	   construction	   BIM	   model.	   Once	   this	   task	   was	   complete,	   the	   VisiLean	    team	    was	    then	    able	    to	    implement	    a	    data	    provider	    that	    allowed	    the	   software	   to	   interpret	   the	   provided	   identifiers	   and	   map	   them	   into	   selections	   on	   screen	   as	   required.	   Once	    the	    model	    was	    properly	    imported	    and	    navigable	    within	    the	    VisiLean	   system,	   the	   plan	   was	   manually	   input	   in	   the	   phase	   planning	   module.	   The	   planning	   tasks	   had	   to	   input	   manually	   as	   they	   were	   created	   in	   custom	   Excel	   spread	   sheet	   used	    by	    the	    contractor.	    The	    plan	    tasks	    were	    then	    linked	    with	    the	    model	   elements.	    Once	    the	    tasks	    and	    BIM	    elements	    were	    linked	    the	    system	    was	   demonstrated	    to	    the	    contractor’s	    lean	    planner	    and	    process	    improvement	   managers	   for	   their	   approval	   to	   try	   the	   system	   during	   their	   next	   look-­‐ahead	   and	   daily	   planning	   sessions.	    	   Apart	   from	   getting	   the	   model	   ready	   and	   importing	   in	   VisiLean	   and	   to	   create	   tasks	   and	   add	   their	   details	   in	   the	   system,	   a	   number	   of	   meetings	   and	   demonstrations	   were	    organised	    to	    familiarise	    the	    team	    with	    the	    VisiLean	    system.	    Initially,	    the	   demonstrations	    served	    to	    get	    the	    “buy	    in”	    from	    the	    team	    and	    to	    capture	    their	   feedback	    on	    the	    system,	    which	    also	    helped	    to	    identify	    their	    requirements.	   Subsequently	   the	   meetings	   were	   organised	   to	   demonstrate	   the	   progress	   with	   the	   imported	   model	   and	   discuss	   specific	   changes	   that	   were	   needed	   to	   be	   made.	    	   6.3.3.2	   Implementation/Demonstrations	   The	   first	   task	   during	   the	   VisiLean	   pilot	   was	   to	   understand	   the	   existing	   lean	   and	   BIM	   processes	   that	   the	   main	   contractor	   had	   been	   following	   and	   to	   identify	   their	   major	   requirements	   from	   VisiLean.	   The	   first	   meeting	   was	   held	   with	   the	   Business	   Improvement	    Manager,	    who	    provided	    information	    regarding	    their	    current	   processes,	    and	    feedback	    regarding	    the	    applicability	    of	    VisiLean	    to	    their	   collaborative	    planning	    process.	    Figure	    46	    shows	    the	    VisiLean	    researcher	   demonstrating	   the	   system	   to	   the	   project	   team.	   The	   company	   had	   been	   using	   their	   own	   collaborative	   planning	   approach,	   where	   there	   were	   four	   main	   planning	   levels,	   i.e.	   master	   planning,	   stage	   planning,	   look	   ahead	   planning	   and	   weekly	   planning.	   Also,	   the	   company	   used	   a	   visual	   measure	   called	   “concern	   and	   countermeasure”	   board	   to	   manage	   some	   of	   the	   constraints.	    	   The	    main	    feedback	    received	    during	    this	    meeting	    was	    that	    the	    construction	   organisation	   had	   been	   looking	   for	   a	   solution	   which	   helped	   integrate/synchronise	   a	   number	   of	   information	   sources	   such	   as	   safety	   management,	   field	   inspections,	   knowledge	    management	    to	    the	    production	    management	    process.	    It	    was	    also	   mentioned	   that	   identification	   of	   temporary	   work	   areas/zones	   and	   treating	   them	   as	    constraints	    would	    also	    be	    very	    useful.	    This	    would	    ensure	    that	    there	    are	    no	   more	    than	    a	    certain	    maximum	    number	    of	    workers	    sharing	    the	    space	    and	    that	   there	   are	   no	   conflicts	   in	   space	   utilisation.	   The	   Business	   Improvement	   Manager	   also	    expressed	    interest	    in	    linking	    daily	    progress	    update	    photographs	    with	    the	   VisiLean	   system	   (in	   both	   the	   planning	   and	   modelling	   windows).	   Subsequently,	   a	   meeting	   with	   a	   senior	   director	   within	   the	   Highways	   Agency	   was	   organised.	    The	    main	    purpose	    of	    this	    meeting	    was	    to	    demonstrate	    the	    system,	   communicate	   the	   main	   project	   objectives	   and	   obtain	   a	   senior	   level	   “buy	   in”	   not	   only	   just	   for	   the	   pilot	   project,	   but	   to	   the	   overall	   integrated	   lean	   and	   BIM	   process	   within	   Highways	   Agency.	   Following	   the	   demonstration	   the	   director	   approved	   the	   pilot	   and	   agreed	   that	   following	   the	   outcome	   of	   this	   project,	   the	   Highways	   Agency	   will	    consider	    the	    integrated	    lean	    and	    BIM	    approach	    for	    their	    subsequent	   projects.	   Following	    the	    approval,	    the	    VisiLean	    demonstration/implementation	    consisted	   of	    a	    series	    of	    planning	    sessions	    where	    the	    VisiLean	    team	    facilitated	    the	   demonstration	   of	   the	   system	   and	   simulated	   the	   collaborative	   planning	   sessions	   using	    actual	    project	    information.

Prior	   to	   each	   meeting,	   the	   VisiLean	   system	   was	   prepared	   by	   importing	   the	   project	   BIM	   model	   and	   by	   importing	   project	   plan.	   During	   the	   meetings,	   the	   VisiLean	   system	   was	   run	   and	   a	   collaborative	   planning	   session	   was	   simulated.	   During	   the	   demonstrations,	   notes	   were	   taken,	   which	   were	   then	   analysed.	   A	   record	   of	   these	   feedback	   sessions	   and	   their	   outcome	   is	   presented	   in	   Table	   31.	   Table	   31.	   Feedback	   from	   pilot	   demonstration	   and	   outcome	   Session Feedback Outcome 05/9/12 In this first session the BIM model was imported to VisiLean and tasks related to installation of ducts were discussed. As the project involved laying communication infrastructure through ducts on two major motorways, it also passed through the intersection. Due to the added complexity of the intersection, it was identified that the tasks around the intersection are the most difficult to visualise, especially when they have are interconnected. It was suggested that the VisiLean system would be especially useful in such complex situations. Upon demonstration of the system, the section engineer in charge of the ducting tasks highlighted the current problem of having to “chase” different systems to get production related information. Especially, the information related to task management, i.e. status of tasks in production (started, stopped, completed, etc.) and also reasons for deviation from the schedule. The section engineer highlighted that a system such as VisiLean will help overcome that problem by having all information in one place. It was recommended that a feature should be added whereby notes can be added to tasks and stored for future auditing. The section engineer also highlighted the usefulness of a system such as VisiLean during daily planning sessions, where they occasionally use a large touch screen and project the plan (in Excel) and the BIM model.  A number of issues with the model were identified at this meeting, which are discussed 6.2.3.1 above. These were due to the model not having full parametric capabilities.  1. A feature was added in the task management window where notes can be added to tasks and stored for future reference.  2. Changes needed with the model were noted so that it can be imported in VisiLean. 21/11/12  When the model was imported in VisiLean and a custom selection tree was built, in the next demonstration a lookahead plan was imported and the model was also available. It was found that due to the lack of hierarchy in the model, there were over 1100 elements just in the ducting work package. This made it extremely difficult to find the relevant BIM element during the planning meeting while trying to link them to the look-ahead plan. Two suggestions were made to overcome this problem. First suggestion was to only include model elements, which had matching tasks in the look-ahead plan. This was a temporary short-term fix and didn’t solve the problem going forward. The second suggestion was to provide a search box, which would enable searching for elements using a string. This was potentially a long-term solution, however, but would need significant changes to the VisiLean system. It was decided edit the model import file in VisiLean so that only those elements with matching tasks in VisiLean would be displayed in the selection tree. This made it easier to link them to the planning window. Session Feedback Outcome 20/12/2012 Once the model was updated to include the limited amount of ducting elements, the planning tasks were linked to the model and their respective constraints were added. At this stage the VisiLean system had the two week look-ahead plan and two weekly plans added to the system and all the tasks were linked to the BIM model.  During this session, the Business Improvement Manager asked if it would be possible to get an “overview” of task statuses in the BIM window. At this stage the VisiLean system only has a “one-to-one” mapping, i.e. only one task/subtask can be selected and respected BIM elements viewed in the BIM window. However, to get a quick overview of the current production status, this would not be very efficient. This requirement was recorded, however due to significant amount of work needed, it was not considered for implementation. The Business Improvement Director also highlighted the benefit of using VisiLean as it can potentially be used as a system that helps “aggregate” all relevant production related information. Although, currently in the VisiLean system this information has to be input manually, going forward the idea is to dynamically link information such as procurement and cost estimating and quantities through relevant information systems.  The feedback received from this final session was used to draft recommendations and document the perception of the project of VisiLean, which were then submitted to the Highways Agency. Due to the limitation of time, it was not possible to make further changes to the VisiLean system and re-implement it to this project. However, some of the features, which were deemed important have been considered for future implementation in 5.9. 17/1/2013 Figure	    44 and Figure	    45 show the VisiLean system demonstration and discussion during the final session. In VisiLean, the final session included the complete two-week look-ahead plan and two weekly plans, along with the links with the BIM model elements. Detailed discussions took place during this session and significant feedback was received relating to the VisiLean system and also what measures should be taken to implement a system such as VisiLean on future projects. The most important discussion revolved around how to create a “common language” across the transport industry so that synchronising the planning tasks and model elements would be a relatively efficient process. As witnessed in VisiLean, almost 30-40% of the effort during the pilot project was dedicated to making changes to the model, first to import it in VisiLean and secondly to link it to the project plan. By creating a commonly accepted method of structuring the model and also preparing the project plan, it would make it easier to link tasks to model elements. Also, the importance of having a fully parametric model, where a well-defined hierarchy of objects is available, was emphasised.  The need to involve main contractor during the design process was also highlighted. The members present during the session felt that at least the project planner and engineering manager should be involved during design to provide knowledge of constructability aspects and to ensure the model  Session Feedback Outcome is developed to a sufficient level of detail so that it can be used properly during the production stage. From VisiLean system point of view, a number of issues were raised. In the current iteration, the VisiLean system did not have any notifications for pending tasks or “unresolved” constraints. The site team suggested that the relevant members should be sent a notification at a set time prior to the weekly planning meeting, reminding them if any of their tasks have constraints, which are not yet resolved. It was also highlighted that an overview “heatmap” in the BIM window, showing the status of the project at a glance should be provided. This means a colour-coded model showing the relevant production status of the tasks.  The Engineering Manager also highlighted the need to have cost and quantity related information linked to the tasks, as this information is very regularly needed and if linked, could help with automated generation of a number of reports. The project team reported a current problem with the planning process in VisiLean, which was related to the weekly planning module. In the current iteration, the VisiLean system would not let the user select a task for execution if it has a predecessor, which is not yet complete. However, the team highlighted a scenario, whereby a sequence of interrelated tasks, which are all scheduled for execution for the same week (and otherwise free of constraints) are there in the look-ahead plan. This was identified, and it was decided that the VisiLean systems should allow releasing such tasks to the weekly plan. The project team found the VisiLean feature of flagging “conflicting resources (constraints)” very useful. As on the current project, one of the formwork subcontractor regularly assigned the same resource to multiple tasks (which are managed by different section engineers), ultimately leading to non-execution of at least some of the tasks. As the current planning is done using Excel spreadsheets which are not linked with each other, this is not detected (unless discussed directly during a meeting). It was mentioned that by clearly showing a conflict between the allocated resources before execution starts would prevent such conflicts and improve the PPC. Overall the feedback was positive and it was recognised that VisiLean bridges a distinct gap in the market, by providing a production management system for the project. It was also suggested that the VisiLean interface should be as simple as possible for it to be used by site personnel and consistent with the collaborative planning process. It was also mentioned that the VisiLean system has a potential to reduce the amount of rework needed while maintaining separate systems for Lean and BIM, and also separate systems to manage the production processes (such as planning spread sheets).  6.3.3.4	   Lessons	   learnt	   and	   summary	   of	   the	   pilot	   project	   The	   main	   lesson	   learnt	   during	   the	   pilot	   was	   that	   for	   any	   software	   system	   such	   as	   VisiLean	   to	   succeed,	   it	   is	   important	   to	   not	   only	   have	   the	   BIM	   model	   in	   place,	   it	   is	   equally	   important	   for	   it	   to	   be	   developed	   with	   proper	   parametric	   capabilities	   and	   to	   an	   appropriate	   level	   of	   detail.	   It	   is	   also	   important	   to	   note	   that	   without	   proper	   collaborative	    planning	    in	    place,	    i.e.	    without	    detailed	    constraints	    analysis,	    the	   effectiveness	   of	   the	   VisiLean	   (or	   a	   similar)	   system	   will	   be	   reduced.	    	   Another	   major	   consideration	   that	   emerged	   during	   the	   pilot	   was	   about	   the	   quality	   and	   depth	   of	   information.	   For	   VisiLean	   to	   succeed,	   constant	   updating	   and	   input	   of	   relevant	   information	   to	   the	   system	   is	   required.	   Without	   the	   daily	   updating	   of	   system,	   the	   system	   won’t	   function	   properly	   and	   provide	   inaccurate	   information,	   which	    could	    even	    be	    detrimental	    to	    the	    overall	    efficiency	    of	    the	    production	   system.	   All	    the	    project	    team	    members	    unanimously	    agreed	    that	    for	    a	    system	    such	    as	   VisiLean	   to	   succeed	   and	   being	   used	   on	   the	   project,	   the	   user	   interface	   has	   to	   be	   very	   simple	   and	   intuitive.	   It	   was	   also	   suggested	   that	   providing	   a	   user	   interface,	   where	   it	   can	   be	   navigated	   using	   touch	   gestures	   will	   be	   better.	   Also,	   the	   proposed	   mobile	   interfaces	   (for	   smart	   phones	   and	   tablets)	   were	   welcomed.	   Overall,	   the	   users	   received	   the	   VisiLean	   system	   in	   a	   positive	   way,	   and	   found	   it	   to	   be	   a	   supporting	   system	   that	   could	   be	   utilised	   after	   the	   suggested	   improvements	   were	   made,	   and	   when	   the	   required	   features	   could	   be	   added.	   6.4	   Current	   state	   of	   development	   and	   its	   critical	   analysis	   Table	   32	   provides	   a	   critical	   evaluation	   of	   VisiLean	   prototype	   in	   its	   current	   form	   based	    on	    the	    relevant	    evaluation	    criteria	    mentioned	    by	    Hevner	    (2004)	    and	   feedback	   received	   (through	   three	   iterations).	    	   Table	   32.	   Current	   state	   of	   development	   and	   its	   critical	   analysis.	   Evaluation Criteria Synthesis of feedback Critical Analysis Functionality The current function set is good to begin with, especially as it provides a way to tackle Last Planner™ workflow in a systematic way, and helps carry out constraints analysis and identifies conflicts between resources. The visualisations of model and production status are also useful functions. A number of additional functions are desired, such as the cost and quantity information, analysis and reporting in form of a dashboard, deeper integration with BIM (by way of simulation of lookahead and weekly plans and multiple task selection). Overall, the current VisiLean system is only the beginning and lacks a number of useful functions. It was designed as a demonstrator of an integrated Lean and BIM system that could help the “Last Planners” with site based planning and control functions. Although it succeeds in that, a number of additional functions will make it stronger and useful on site. Completeness In its current form VisiLean is not a complete system, as the above-mentioned features are missing. It is a starting point on which other functions could be added. However, for organisations using just Post IT™ notes and paper-based workflow, it provides an opportunity to rethink their approach and have a system that integrates product and process views, i.e. through Lean and BIM. As the feedback suggests, the current system does not provide a complete set of functionality but demonstrates the functionality a potential lean and BIM system could have and justifies the research themes of integration, synchronisation and visualisation. Performance & Reliability As VisiLean is still in a prototype stage, it is too early to comment on performance on reliability. It is not a reliable system in its current form as it crashes often and has inconsistencies in behaviour. Performance with the tested dataset has been found to be satisfactory, with information display and visualisation being instantaneous and no lags in model visualisation either. However, the prototype has not been tested with a large project and a complete project plan (i.e. end-to-end), which would push the system to its limits both hardware and software wise. Further testing, development and pilots would improve the system from its current stage. It is not a commercial grade system and still contains a number of bugs and suffers from frequent crashing (unexpected shutdown, corruption of data, etc.). However, it has not been developed with substantial resources and is meant as a proof of concept.  Usability Here, usability is understood as a quality of the system that makes it intuitive and “easy to use” for the intended user. The intended users are members of the construction team on site. The VisiLean Although usability has been one of the key factors driving the VisiLean design, it has not been possible to implement all the desired features due to resource prototype, when shown to the user base was found to be intuitive in use and not a significant amount of training had to be provided before users understood the functions behind the system. However, a number of issues remained to be resolved. For example, a Post IT™ note type Lookahead and Weekly Planning interface that could support collaborative planning (in its current form) has not been implemented. If implemented, this would mean that users of the traditional Last Planner™ system would find it highly intuitive to use and its collaborative appeal would improve.  restrictions. One of the main features is the “touch friendliness” where the system could be driven by using just fingers (rather than traditional keyboard and mouse interface) hence could easily be used on a touchscreen. In its current form the dialog boxes are a little small and spaces between task grid (or lines) not sufficient for a touch based experience. Future versions and research should focus specifically on the user interface improvement aspects and improve the usability further. Fit 	with organisation Although the system in its current form would appeal to most of the project and management team, there are still a large number of workers who are not ready to use a computer-based system for collaborative planning. Also, a number of internal champions believe that having a computerised system for production planning and control and visualisation of design adds to variability in the system (due to possible downtime and reliability and user acceptance issues), hence affecting the productivity of the team in general. Hence, a user buy-in and an extensive change management effort are needed before the VisiLean system could be implemented. It is well understood that any new major technology or process implementation requires a substantial process change within an organisation. Depending on the current maturity with Lean and BIM within a target organisation, a potential VisiLean implementation would also need an element of change management and user training before it is accepted for use. However, given the current “drive” especially through the UK government’s BIM mandate and Latham and Egan’s recommendations to implement Lean, majority of the organisations are already implementing or considering implementation of both these practices. This would potentially support the case for VisiLean (or a similar system’s) implementation. 	   		   Table	   32	   provides	   a	   critical	   analysis	   of	   the	   current	   state	   of	   development	   within	   the	   evaluation	   framework	   suggested	   by	   Hevner	   et	   al.	   (2004).	   It	   emerges	   from	   the	   critical	    evaluation	    and	    through	    own	    interpretation	    that	    VisiLean	    is	    still	    an	   incomplete	   system	   with	   several	   shortcomings,	   such	   as	   lack	   of	   distributed	   access,	   lack	    of	    cost	    and	    quantity	    information,	    and	    that	    there	    is	    scope	    in	    developing	   VisiLean	    further.	    This	    aspect	    is	    further	    explored	    in	    Section	    5.8	    and	    5.9,	   (unimplemented	   features	   and	   plans	   for	   future	   development).	    	   Separately,	    the	    evaluation	    process	    itself	    had	    its	    limitations	    during	    VisiLean	   research,	   to	   be	   outlined	   next.	    	   As	    discussed	    in	    Chapter	    5	    and	    6,	    the	    evaluations	    were	    carried	    out	    in	    three	   separate	   yet	   interconnected	   phases,	   namely	   a) In	   process	   evaluation	   –	   i.e.	   constantly	   evaluating	   the	   prototype	   as	   it	   was	   being	    developed.	    This	    was	    mostly	    done	    by	    the	    VisiLean	    development	   team	   internally.	   b) External	    evaluations	    through	    interviews	    and	    workshops	    and	    a	    limited	   pilot	   –	   these	   evaluations	   were	   carried	   out	   with	   construction	   professionals	   by	   demonstrating	   the	   software	   and	   asking	   for	   their	   feedback.	   c) Final	   critical	   evaluation	   against	   criteria	   set	   by	   Hevner	   et	   al.	   (2004)	   and	   own	   reflection	   on	   the	   artefact	   as	   it	   has	   developed,	   as	   reported	   in	   Table	   32.	   Although	   the	   evaluation	   in	   most	   parts	   went	   as	   planned,	   the	   pilot	   project	   did	   not	   complete	    as	    originally	    hoped.	    This	    was	    due	    to	    the	    problems	    highlighted	    in	   Chapter	    6,	    mainly	    as	    there	    were	    issues	    with	    the	    BIM	    model	    that	    had	    to	    be	   corrected,	    which	    affected	    the	    time	    available	    to	    carry	    out	    a	    full	    pilot.	    Hence,	   instead	   of	   working	   with	   actual	   project	   data	   and	   supporting	   live	   planning	   sessions	   as	    originally	    planned,	    only	    simulation	    of	    project	    data	    and	    planning	    meetings	   could	   be	   carried	   out.	    	   Nevertheless,	    the	    achieved	    level	    of	    evaluation	    is	    in	    broad	    alignment	    with	    the	   views	    presented	    on	    evaluation	    in	    the	    Design	    Science	    Research	    methodology	   literature	    such	    as	    Hevner	    et	    al.	    (2004)	    and	    Lukka	    (2003).	    Scholars	    have	   mentioned	   that	   rigorous	   evaluation	   methods	   are	   extremely	   difficult	   to	   apply	   in	   design	    science	    research	    (Hevner	    et	    al.,	    2004).	    Moreover,	    it	    is	    not	    possible	    to	   generalise	   the	   evaluation	   to	   other	   projects	   if	   the	   evaluation	   has	   only	   been	   carried	   out	   on	   a	   single	   project	   (Markus	   et	   al.,	   2002).	   6.5	   Summary	   Evaluation	   is	   one	   of	   the	   most	   important	   aspects	   of	   design	   science	   research	   as	   the	   usefulness	   of	   the	   artefact	   depends	   greatly	   on	   the	   quality	   and	   depth	   of	   evaluation.	   From	   that	   perspective,	   this	   research	   benefited	   from	   a	   large	   group	   of	   participants	   who	    took	    active	    part	    in	    all	    aspects	    of	    evaluation	    and	    provided	    their	    valuable	   feedback.	   The	   research	   also	   benefitted	   largely	   from	   a	   funded	   pilot	   project,	   where	   it	    was	    possible	    to	    implement	    VisiLean	    prototype	    on	    an	    on-­‐going	    construction	   project	   as	   reported	   in	   6.2	    	   In	   general,	   the	   feedback	   received	   during	   the	   evaluation	   was	   positive.	   One	   of	   the	   factors	   in	   measuring	   the	   success	   of	   design	   science	   research	   according	   to	   Kasanen	   et	   al.	   (1993)	   (this	   is	   also	   called	   a	   “weak	   market	   test”)	   is	   when	   a	   manager	   agrees	   to	   try/pilot	   the	   solution.	   In	   the	   case	   of	   VisiLean,	   a	   number	   of	   organisations	   were	   willing	   to	   pilot	   it	   on	   their	   on-­‐going	   projects,	   and	   one	   such	   pilot	   was	   carried	   out	   during	   the	   scope	   of	   this	   research.	   Two	   further	   pilot	   projects	   have	   been	   identified	   and	    potentially	    will	    be	    carried	    out	    in	    future.	    This	    partially	    demonstrates	    the	   effectiveness	   and	   practical	   value	   of	   VisiLean	   solution.	   During	    the	    demonstrations,	    the	    relevance	    of	    the	    VisiLean	    system	    and	    its	   potential	    to	    support	    productivity	    improvements	    were	    highlighted	    by	    most	   participants.	    However,	    there	    was	    also	    some	    scepticism	    expressed	    by	    the	   participants	   regarding	   the	   introduction	   of	   an	   “untested”	   technological	   solution	   to	   the	   production	   process,	   as	   this	   could	   lead	   to	   increased	   variability	   and	   risk	   in	   the	   production	    environment.	    This	    was	    also	    due	    to	    the	    fact	    that	    many	    of	    the	   participants	    were	    familiar	    with	    the	    lean	    production	    processes	    and	    feared	    that	   VisiLean	    may	    hamper/affect	    the	    collaborative	    nature	    of	    the	    lean	    projects.	   However,	    as	    VisiLean	    does	    not	    aim	    to	    replace	    the	    collaborative	    nature	    of	    the	   planning	   process,	   but	   tries	   to	   augment/support	   it,	   the	   scepticism	   was	   reduced	   and	   the	   acceptance	   of	   the	   system	   grew	   considerably.	   Also,	   as	   outlined	   in	   the	   critical	   review	   of	   the	   current	   development,	   some	   of	   the	   features	   requested	   by	   participants	   were	   missing	   from	   VisiLean	   prototype.	   These	   features	   would	   certainly	   add	   value	   to	   VisiLean	   and	   can	   potentially	   make	   VisiLean	   a	   capable	   production	   management	   system.	    	   As	   mentioned	   in	   Chapter	   5,	   the	   design,	   development	   and	   evaluation	   processes	   are	   iterative	   and	   incremental,	   and	   further	   VisiLean	   development	   will	   continue	   to	   follow	   the	   same	   pattern.	   However,	   it	   is	   anticipated	   that	   in	   future,	   the	   evaluation	   will	   be	   based	   around	   the	   pilot	   projects	   where	   practical	   applicability	   of	   features	   will	   be	   tested	   on	   live	   environment	   as	   new	   features	   are	   added	   to	   the	   system.	   In	   its	   current	   form,	   VisiLean	   should	   not	   be	   taken	   as	   an	   “industrial	   strength”	   product,	   but	    a	    research	    prototype	    with	    limitations,	    which	    has	    been	    developed	    to	   demonstrate	   the	   benefits	   of	   an	   integrated	   lean	   and	   BIM	   system.	   
7	   Discussion	   and	   Conclusion	   This	    Chapter	    provides	    an	    overview	    of	    the	    research	    and	    main	    conclusions.	    The	   chapter	    begins	    with	    a	    discussion	    on	    main	    findings	    for	    each	    key	    stage	    of	    the	   research	   and	   follows	   on	   with	   a	   summary	   of	   main	   conclusions	   and	   direction	   of	   future	   research.	   7.1	   Discussion	   This	   discussion	   is	   about	   the	   overall	   research	   and	   not	   the	   research	   artefact,	   which	   was	    discussed	    in	    Chapter	    6.	    The	    main	    aim	    for	    research	    was	    to	    improve	   construction	   management	   through	   application	   of	   Lean	   and	   BIM.	   Additionally,	   it	   was	   hypothesised	   that	   the	   deficiencies	   of	   the	   production	   management	   systems	   could	    be	    addressed	    through	    a	    software	    solution	    that	    integrates	    process	    and	   production	    visualisation.	    The	    main	    problem	    being	    addressed	    was	    grounded	    in	   practice	   and	   emerged	   from	   the	   author’s	   own	   observations	   but	   also	   had	   potential	   for	   theoretical	   contribution.	   Although	    the	    overall	    research	    experience	    has	    been	    positive,	    a	    number	    of	   problems	   were	   encountered	   during	   the	   research.	   The	   most	   significant	   problem	   can	   be	   considered	   as	   the	   limited	   number	   of	   alternative	   solutions,	   which	   could	   be	   considered	    or	    developed	    for	    VisiLean.	    This	    means	    that	    further	    possibilities	    of	   experimentation	   with	   a	   wide	   range	   of	   aspects	   such	   as	   user	   interface,	   workflow,	   reporting,	   etc.	   exist	   that	   can	   be	   considered	   for	   future	   research.	    	    	   The	   main	   observations	   from	   research	   are	   presented	   in	   three	   separate	   sections,	   research	    method	    and	    problem	    identification,	    research	    solution	    and	    research	   evaluation.	   7.1.1	   Research	   Method	   and	   Problem	   Identification	   According	    to	    Lukka	    (2003)	    and	    Hevner	    et	    al.	    (2004),	    selecting	    a	    practical	   problem	    that	    also	    has	    relevance	    for	    the	    industry	    and	    finding	    long-­‐term	   partnership/cooperation	    with	    organisations	    are	    important	    aspects	    of	    design	   science	    research.	    The	    perceived	    relevance	    and	    importance	    of	    the	    solution	    and	   research	    itself	    within	    the	    participating	    organisations	    provided	    significant	   motivation	   to	   the	   author.	   The	   problem	   selection	   and	   its	   relevance	   in	   real	   world	   are	   two	   important	   aspects	   in	   design	   science	   research	   method.	   The	   author	   had	   a	   first	   hand	   knowledge	   of	   the	   problem	    area,	    which	    helped	    considerably	    in	    understanding	    the	    context	    of	   research	   and	   also	   while	   evaluating	   alternatives	   during	   design	   and	   development.	    	   As	   the	   research	   was	   being	   conducted	   within	   a	   well-­‐established	   research	   centre	   that	   had	   strong	   ties	   with	   the	   industry,	   it	   was	   possible	   to	   receive	   feedback	   from	   a	   large	    number	    of	    practitioners	    throughout	    the	    research	    process.	    The	    design	   science	   method	   provided	   a	   flexible	   yet	   a	   structured	   approach,	   where	   a	   number	   of	   evaluation	    instruments	    were	    used	    throughout	    the	    research,	    including	    focus	   group	    interviews,	    workshops,	    meetings	    and	    finally	    a	    pilot	    project	    to	    gather	   feedback	   and	   evaluate	   the	   research.	   The	    evaluation	    process	    also	    encountered	    a	    number	    of	    difficulties,	    especially	   during	   the	   pilot	   project.	   The	   main	   lesson	   learnt	   was	   that	   technological	   solutions	   (such	   as	   VisiLean)	   require	   careful	   consideration	   of	   people	   and	   processes	   within	   the	   target	   organisation	   and	   it	   is	   very	   important	   to	   plan	   the	   implementation	   in	   advance.	   The	   implementation	   of	   Lean	   and	   BIM	   have	   implications	   right	   up	   to	   the	   design	   process,	   where	   the	   BIM	   model	   has	   to	   be	   developed	   at	   the	   right	   level	   of	   detail	   and	   having	   the	   correct	   object	   parameters	   and	   structure.	   Also,	   the	   use	   of	   appropriate	    BIM	    tools	    and	    mutually	    compatible	    platforms	    is	    one	    of	    the	   significant	   considerations.	   7.1.2	   Design	   and	   Development	   of	   the	   Research	   Solution	   Lukka	   (2003)	   emphasises	   the	   importance	   of	   this	   stage,	   as	   the	   innovative	   solution	   to	    be	    designed	    is	    the	    core	    aspect	    of	    the	    research,	    and	    it	    is	    important	    to	   distinguish	    the	    constructive	    and	    innovation	    oriented	    research	    from	    a	    simple	   transfer	   of	   off-­‐the-­‐shelf	   solution.	   Here,	   the	   research	   solution	   was	   developed	   in	   three	    interconnected	    stages,	    narrowing	    down	    the	    solution	    areas,	    developing	    a	   solution	   framework	   and	   designing	   and	   developing	   the	   solution.	   First	   the	   solution	   area	    was	    narrowed	    down	    to	    lean	    construction	    and	    Building	    Information	   Modelling,	   as	   it	   was	   identified	   that	   both	   process	   and	   product	   management	   are	   important	    from	    production	    management	    perspective.	    Following	    the	   identification	    of	    broad	    solution	    areas,	    it	    emerged	    that	    the	    synergies	    between	   Lean	   Construction	   and	   BIM	   span	   the	   entire	   lifecycle	   of	   the	   construction	   process,	   and	    there	    are	    significant	    interactions	    between	    Lean	    and	    BIM	    during	    the	   production	    management	    stage.	    Empirical	    evidence	    emerged	    supporting	    these	   synergies,	   which	   is	   highlighted	   in	   the	   56	   individual	   interactions	   in	   Table	   15.	   This	   conceptual	   framework	   of	   interaction	   between	   Lean	   and	   BIM	   can	   be	   considered	   a	   high	    level	    conceptual	    framework	    that	    contributed	    to	    the	    development	    of	    the	   VisiLean	    system.	    This	    led	    to	    the	    next	    stage	    of	    development	    of	    the	    high	    level	   framework	   based	   on	   which	   the	   core	   requirements	   for	   VisiLean	   were	   developed.	   Subsequently,	    a	    conceptual	    solution	    in	    form	    of	    the	    VisiLean	    prototype	    was	   designed	   and	   developed	   through	   three	   major	   iterations.	   The	   development	   process	   was	   a	   highly	   collaborative	   process	   where	   the	   author	   engaged	    constantly	    with	    the	    industrial	    participants	    and	    the	    programmer,	   evaluating	   the	   solution	   at	   each	   stage	   and	   carefully	   considering	   the	   next	   steps	   to	   be	    taken.	    The	    agile	    development	    method	    that	    was	    selected	    during	    the	   development	    of	    VisiLean	    solution	    was	    suitable	    given	    the	    small	    team	    and	    its	   ability	   to	   support	   rapid	   prototyping	   and	   evaluations.	   During	    the	    development	    of	    VisiLean,	    additional	    requirements	    emerged,	    for	   example	    support	    of	    additional	    workflows	    such	    as	    quality,	    safety	    and	    cost	   management.	   Although	   these	   were	   not	   originally	   thought	   of	   as	   core	   functions	   of	   VisiLean,	    it	    was	    recognised	    that	    the	    potential	    users	    (research	    participants)	   would	   value	   them	   significantly.	   Also,	   it	   emerged	   during	   the	   development	   process	   that	    a	    system	    such	    as	    VisiLean	    could	    also	    support	    creation	    and	    reuse	    of	   collaborative	   knowledge	   that	   is	   integrated	   within	   the	   production	   system.	   Overall,	   VisiLean	   prototype	   encompassed	   features	   that	   would	   support	   the	   product	   and	   process	   integration,	   visualisation	   and	   synchronisation	   through	   the	   support	   of	   the	   Last	   Planner™	   workflow	   and	   integration	   with	   BIM.	   7.1.3	   Research	   Evaluation	   Evaluation	   is	   considered	   as	   an	   integral	   part	   of	   the	   design	   science	   research,	   where	   both	   the	   newly	   constructed	   solution	   and	   the	   process	   of	   implementing	   it	   in	   the	   target	    organisation	    are	    tested.	    As	    reported	    in	    Chapter	    6,	    a	    large	    number	    of	   evaluations	   took	   place	   during	   the	   lifecycle	   of	   research,	   as	   the	   solution	   area,	   top-­level	   research	   framework	   and	   each	   development	   iterations	   were	   evaluated.	    	   One	   of	   the	   most	   critical	   aspects	   was	   that	   to	   make	   the	   production	   management	   system	    available/accessible	    to	    the	    construction	    team,	    and	    to	    ensure	    that	    it	    is	   simple	    and	    intuitive	    in	    nature	    so	    that	    it	    is	    accepted	    by	    the	    site	    teams.	    The	   VisiLean	    system	    successfully	    demonstrated	    this,	    and	    it	    can	    be	    said	    that	    it	    was	   successful	   in	   solving	   the	   practical	   problem	   that	   was	   originally	   set	   out.	   It	   emerged	   during	   evaluations	   that	   a	   solution	   such	   as	   VisiLean	   had	   its	   uses	   for	   a	   number	    of	    organisational	    roles	    on	    a	    construction	    project.	    For	    example,	    it	   appealed	    to	    both	    middle	    management	    (such	    as	    project	    managers,	    business	   improvement	    managers,	    BIM	    managers)	    and	    site-­‐based	    personnel	    (site	   managers,	    site	    supervisors,	    foremen,	    etc.).	    Several	    of	    these	    participants	   highlighted	    the	    immediate	    need	    for	    such	    a	    solution	    in	    the	    industry	    after	   demonstration	   and	   mentioned	   that	   no	   parallel/similar	   solution	   yet	   exist	   in	   the	   market.	   Also,	   as	   mentioned	   in	   Chapter	   6,	   several	   requests	   for	   testing	   the	   solution	   in	   participants’	   organisations	   were	   received,	   which	   in	   itself	   partly	   validated	   the	   research	   idea	   and	   solution.	   However,	   a	   number	   of	   shortcomings	   of	   the	   VisiLean	   prototype	   also	   emerged,	   and	   a	   number	   of	   features	   remained	   unimplemented	   due	   to	   time	   and	   resource	   shortage.	   Also,	   the	   final	   evaluation	   in	   the	   pilot	   project	   did	   not	   proceed	   as	   planned,	   hence	   it	   is	   recommended	   that	   future	   evaluations	   on	   pilot	   projects	   should	   be	   carried	   out	   to	   strengthen	   the	   findings.	   Overall,	    it	    can	    be	    concluded	    from	    evaluations	    that	    the	    designed	    artefact	   (VisiLean)	   was	   mostly	   successful	   in	   achieving	   original	   research	   objectives,	   and	   the	   evaluation	   process	   itself	   was	   suitable	   for	   the	   type	   of	   research	   it	   supported.	   The	    overall	    aim	    of	    the	    research	    that	    integration	    of	    product	    and	    process	    views	   could	   improve	   the	   production	   process	   was	   demonstrated.	   7.2	   Contribution	   to	   knowledge	   The	    most	    important	    contribution	    to	    knowledge	    in	    this	    research	    is	    the	    newly	   designed	    artefact	    itself,	    i.e.	    VisiLean.	    VisiLean	    as	    a	    system	    embodies	    the	   knowledge	    that	    was	    generated	    through	    this	    research	    and	    helps	    overcome	    a	   practical	   problem	   identified	   during	   the	   early	   stage	   of	   the	   research.	   The	   VisiLean	   system	    successfully	    demonstrated	    that	    the	    integration	    of	    process	    and	    product	   visualisation	   is	   beneficial	   to	   the	   production	   management	   process	   in	   construction.	   And	    also	    that	    a	    lean	    production	    management	    system	    built	    on	    such	    a	    visual	   foundation	    is	    perceived	    to	    be	    beneficial	    by	    the	    production	    teams	    on	    site.	    This	   particular	   aspect	   of	   a	   construction	   management	   system	   specifically	   designed	   for	   the	   use	   of	   construction	   project	   itself	   (during	   execution)	   was	   also	   perceived	   as	   a	   novel	   and	   useful	   concept	   during	   evaluations.	   On	   a	   broader	   level,	   the	   research	   makes	   contributions	   to	   the	   theory	   of	   production.	   Koskela	   (2000)	   put	   forward	   the	   TFV	   theory	   of	   production	   and	   argued	   that	   the	   dominance	   of	   transformation	   view	   in	   production	   has	   resulted	   in	   highly	   unstable	   and	   inefficient	   systems.	   Much	   has	   since	   been	   discussed	   regarding	   the	   application	   of	    TFV	    theory	    in	    production	    and	    the	    overall	    construction	    process	    including	   design.	   The	   ramifications	   of	   the	   “T”	   view	   have	   been	   one	   strand	   of	   that	   discussion.	   However,	   they	   are	   not	   only	   limited	   to	   the	   production/construction	   management	   aspects,	   but	   their	   effects	   on	   other	   aspects	   such	   as	   information	   systems	   have	   been	   relatively	    neglected.	    The	    predominance	    of	    transformation	    view	    has	    led	    to	    silo	   type	   organisations,	   deep	   work	   breakdown	   structures,	   individual	   optimisation	   of	   processes	   (as	   opposed	   to	   the	   holistic	   view)	   and	   a	   general	   neglect	   of	   the	   flow	   and	   value	   aspects	   in	   production.	   Importantly,	   it	   also	   has	   had	   negative	   impacts	   on	   the	   information	    systems	    applied/implemented	    within	    the	    construction	    industry,	   which	    emerged	    as	    a	    separate	    finding	    during	    this	    research.	    Over	    the	    years,	    the	   information	    systems	    have	    been	    developed	    to	    support	    construction	    processes,	   which	   were	   controlled	   or	   designed	   from	   transformation	   viewpoint.	   As	   a	   result	   their	    effectiveness	    has	    been	    less	    than	    satisfactory,	    and	    in	    certain	    cases	   counterproductive	   as	   discussed	   in	   Chapter	   3.	   Similarly	   there	   have	   been	   negative	   impacts	   on	   people	   (organisational)	   issues,	   and	   Table	   6	   shows	   the	   effects	   of	   TFV	   on	   people,	   process	   and	   technologies.	   This	    research	    demonstrates	    that	    not	    only	    it	    is	    important	    to	    satisfy	    TFV	    goals	   while	   designing	   production	   management	   system,	   but	   it	   is	   equally	   important	   that	   the	   information	   systems	   that	   support	   the	   production	   management	   systems	   also	   support	   these	   goals.	   It	   was	   also	   recognised	   that	   in	   order	   to	   design	   an	   efficient	   information	   system,	   all	   three	   TFV	   goals	   should	   be	   realised.	   Consequently,	   Table	   19	   in	   Chapter	   5	   outlined	   how	   VisiLean	   features	   address	   TFV	   requirements.	   From	   this	    perspective,	    it	    can	    be	    considered	    that	    this	    research	    makes	    direct	   contribution	   to	   the	   TFV	   theory	   within	   the	   context	   of	   information	   systems,	   as	   it	   identifies	   the	   effects	   of	   TFV	   on	   information	   systems	   design	   and	   implementation	   in	   construction,	   and	   more	   importantly	   addresses	   the	   TFV	   goals	   through	   VisiLean	   as	   demonstrated	   in	   Table	   33.	   Table	   33.	   VisiLean's	   Contribution	   to	   TFV	   Theory.	   VisiLean Feature Transformation Flow Value Process visualisation Directly supports the production management process by providing suitable interfaces for the Last Planners.  Ensures minimal wastage during production by eliminating process clashes. Supports flow activities by providing a constraints management interface, and also by highlighting process clashes during execution.  Costs can be predicted and controlled better. Also reduced waste leads to reduced costs, which can be invested in value adding features (this is not same as value engineering, where the focus in on cost reduction). Product visualisation Provides the construction team a direct visualisation of “what” is to be constructed and “where”, directly supporting the transformation goals. By providing the visual workflow of the tasks in hand, through simulation of phase, look-ahead, or weekly plan the system supports the flow activities in an efficient way Through better visualisation of the design intent and what the client originally intended improves the value to the client Product and Process integration Improves the understanding of what is to be constructed, where and when.  Through integration of constraints analysis and status in production visualisation, improves the flow visualisation. Reduces process waste (waiting time, variability and rework) ultimately improves quality and value. In	    addition	    to	    the	    contribution	    to	    TFV	    theory	    as	    outlined	    above,	    the	    VisiLean	   research	   has	   provided	   a	   potential	   framework	   to	   improve	   three	   key	   aspects	   of	   the	   production	    management	    system	    in	    construction,	    namely	    Visualisation,	   Integration	   and	   Synchronisation.	   A	   discussion	   on	   each	   of	   these	   is	   provided	   next.	   Visualisation.	   Tezel	   (2010)	   outlined	   the	   importance	   and	   effectiveness	   of	   visual	   information	    in	    a	    production	    management	    system.	    The	    VisiLean	    framework	   provides	   simultaneous	   visualisation	   of	   product	   and	   process	   views	   of	   production.	   This	   particular	   aspect	   has	   proved	   to	   be	   the	   most	   beneficial	   during	   evaluations	   and	   it	   emerges	   that	   it	   should	   be	   one	   of	   the	   core	   features	   of	   any	   future	   production	   management	    system	    implementation.	    Production	    planning,	    scheduling	    and	   control	   should	   not	   be	   carried	   out	   in	   isolation	   but	   rather	   be	   visually	   integrated	   with	    the	    product	    model.	    Particularly	    the	    visual	    aspects	    such	    as	    colour	   synchronisation	   of	   tasks	   (in	   the	   planning	   view)	   and	   BIM	   elements	   (in	   the	   model	   view)	    based	    on	    the	    current	    production	    status;	    visual	    flagging	    of	    resource	   conflicts	   and	   visual	   Pop-­‐Ups	   displaying	   production	   related	   information	   on	   BIM	   element	    could	    be	    singled	    out	    as	    the	    most	    important	    contributions.	    The	   production	    status	    visualisation	    can	    be	    likened	    with	    visual	    “Andon”	    where	    the	   workers	    can	    flag	    upcoming	    and	    current	    problems	    by	    pressing	    an	    appropriate	   button	   in	   the	   system.	   Similarly,	   the	   task	   completion	   and	   readiness	   visualisations	   can	   be	   likened	   with	   KanBan	   implementation,	   supporting	   the	   “pulling”	   of	   work,	   rather	   than	   the	   “push”	   in	   the	   traditional	   system.	   Integration.	   Integration	   in	   VisiLean	   is	   two	   fold,	   integration	   of	   production	   related	   information	    in	    a	    single	    platform	    and	    integration	    of	    product	    and	    process	   information	    (through	    lean	    and	    BIM	    systems),	    where	    both	    these	    aspects	    are	   equally	    important.	    Through	    the	    implementation	    of	    resource	    management	    in	   form	    of	    constraints	    and	    tracking	    of	    constraint	    status	    (i.e.	    the	    availability	    of	    a	   required	    resource	    on	    site),	    the	    VisiLean	    system	    integrates	    several	    information	   flows	    that	    typically	    have	    been	    managed	    manually	    on	    site	    (through	    traditional	   communication	   methods).	    	   Synchronisation.	    Synchronisation	    also	    refers	    to	    two	    distinct	    yet	    connected	   aspects	   in	   VisiLean,	   namely	   synchronisation	   of	   up-­‐to-­‐date	   product	   and	   process	   views,	   and	   synchronisation	   of	   production	   status	   with	   both	   process	   and	   product	   views.	    As	    both	    parts	    of	    the	    system,	    the	    production	    planning	    and	    control	   workflow	   and	   the	   BIM	   model,	   are	   kept	   updated	   on	   a	   continual	   basis,	   they	   always	   reflect	   the	   up-­‐to-­‐date	   information	   leading	   to	   much	   better	   accuracy	   in	   planning	   and	   execution.	    	   In	   summary,	   it	   can	   be	   emphasized	   that	   although	   the	   separate	   implementation	   of	   these	   aspects	   is	   not	   unique,	   the	   presence	   of	   all	   three	   aspects	   in	   a	   single	   system	   is	   unique	    and	    innovative	    and	    is	    also	    one	    of	    the	    main	    contributions	    of	    VisiLean	   research.	   There	   are	   several	   other	   factors	   to	   consider	   while	   assessing	   the	   contributions	   to	   knowledge	   and	   theory,	   and	   as	   the	   VisiLean	   development	   is	   in	   a	   nascent	   stage	   and	   only	    one	    pilot	    project	    has	    been	    conducted	    so	    far,	    there	    is	    a	    potential	    for	   additional	   contributions	   to	   emerge.	    	   7.3	   Limitations	   of	   research	   In	   Section	   6.4,	   the	   critical	   evaluation	   of	   the	   current	   VisiLean	   prototype	   has	   been	   provided	    against	    a	    framework.	    Some	    shortcomings	    of	    the	    system	    have	    been	   identified	    from	    a	    point	    of	    view	    of	    completeness,	    usability,	    reliability,	    etc.	   Additionally,	   it	   emerges	   that	   the	   evaluation	   process	   itself	   had	   limitations,	   as	   the	   pilot	   project	   could	   not	   be	   completed	   as	   planned.	   One	    of	    the	    main	    root	    causes	    behind	    the	    limitations	    of	    the	    research	    was	    of	   available	   time	   and	   resources,	   due	   to	   which	   only	   one	   pilot	   study	   of	   limited	   scope	   could	    be	    carried	    out.	    As	    a	    result,	    the	    evaluation	    and	    further	    refinement	    of	   VisiLean	    as	    a	    whole	    could	    only	    be	    carried	    out	    to	    a	    certain	    extent	    as	    reported.	   However,	    this	    was	    partly	    compensated	    by	    continuous	    evaluations	    carried	    out	   through	   demonstrations	   during	   meetings	   and	   workshops.	   Similarly,	   due	   to	   the	   above-­‐mentioned	   limitations,	   only	   one	   solution	   candidate	   could	    be	    developed.	    If	    these	    constraints	    were	    not	    present,	    possibility	    of	   developing	    several	    solution	    candidates	    to	    demonstrate	    different	    user	    interface	   designs,	    distinct	    process-­‐product	    integration	    characteristics	    and	    utilisation	    of	   different	   platforms	   such	   as	   mobile	   and	   web	   could	   be	   undertaken.	   Finally,	   as	   VisiLean	   was	   developed	   as	   part	   of	   a	   research	   project,	   it	   could	   not	   go	   through	   a	   rigorous	   testing	   process	   as	   commercial	   software	   systems,	   and	   hence	   can	   only	   be	   considered	   a	   prototype	   system	   that	   is	   not	   yet	   suitable	   for	   industrial	   deployment.	   7.4	   Future	   research	   A	   number	   of	   topics	   emerged	   during	   this	   research,	   which	   could	   not	   be	   considered	   due	   the	   limitations	   of	   scope,	   and	   are	   proposed	   as	   topics	   for	   future	   research.	    	   7.4.1.	   VisiLean	   in	   Design	   One	   important	   aspect	   that	   emerged	   was	   the	   application	   of	   VisiLean	   during	   the	   design	   stage.	   Several	   participants	   highlighted	   that	   they	   have	   started	   to	   consider	   design	   as	   production,	   and	   are	   applying	   the	   Last	   Planner™	   method	   of	   production	   planning	   to	   the	   design	   process.	   These	   organisations	   expressed	   the	   desire	   to	   test	   VisiLean	   during	   the	   design	   stage.	   Future	   research	   could	   focus	   on	   development	   of	   a	    framework	    based	    on	    which	    a	    system	    such	    as	    VisiLean	    could	    be	    extended	    to	   support	    the	    design	    stage,	    and	    bridge	    the	    gaps	    between	    the	    design	    and	   construction	   phases,	   resulting	   in	   efficiency	   improvements.	   7.4.2	   VisiLean	   in	   the	   Field	   As	   highlighted	   in	   Chapter	   5,	   use	   of	   VisiLean	   in	   the	   field	   emerged	   as	   an	   important	   feature	   for	   most	   participants,	   especially	   participants	   belonging	   to	   construction	   organisations.	   Production	   happens	   in	   the	   field,	   and	   if	   VisiLean	   as	   a	   production	   system	   can	   be	   extended	   on	   mobile	   platforms	   such	   as	   Smart	   Phones	   and	   tablets	   computers,	    it	    could	    make	    the	    production	    even	    more	    efficient,	    was	    the	   predominant	   view	   expressed	   by	   participants.	   Specific	   features	   related	   to	   the	   field	   application	    aspect	    of	    VisiLean	    can	    be	    found	    in	    Chapter	    5.	    In	    future,	    dedicated	   mobile	    applications	    or	    web	    based	    universal	    applications	    (such	    as	    in	    HTML5)	   could	   be	   designed	   to	   support	   field	   application.	    	   7.4.3	   Other	   Features	   Several	    other	    features	    such	    as	    cost	    and	    quantity	    integration	    at	    the	    task	    level,	   integration	    of	    the	    quality	    and	    safety	    workflow	    and	    support	    of	    collaborative	   knowledge	   management	   can	   be	   recommended	   for	   future	   research.	   7.4	   Conclusions	   The	   research	   was	   addressing	   a	   two-­‐fold	   research	   problem,	   first	   to	   address	   the	   deficiencies	   	within	   	the	   	production	   	planning	   	process	   	and	   	secondly	   	to	   demonstrate	   that	   it	   is	   possible	   to	   achieve	   improve	   production	   management	   with	   efficient	   information	   systems.	   It	   can	   be	   concluded	   that	   the	   research	   largely	   achieved	   the	   original	   objectives	   as	   originally	    set	    out.	    Through	    VisiLean	    it	    was	    demonstrated	    that	    it	    is	    possible	    to	   support	    the	    production	    planning	    and	    control	    process	    on	    construction	    sites	    by	   integrating	    product	    and	    process	    visualisation	    through	    lean	    construction	    and	   BIM.	   Also,	   it	   can	   be	   concluded	   that	   the	   design	   science	   method	   was	   appropriate	   for	   the	   chosen	   type	   of	   research	   and	   future	   research	   in	   the	   area	   of	   information	   science	   within	   the	   construction	   may	   refer	   to	   this	   process.	    	   The	    main	    conclusions	    from	    problem	    analysis	    were	    that	    the	    production	   management	    systems,	    especially	    the	    traditional	    planning	    and	    control	    systems	   were	    predominantly	    based	    on	    the	    “T”	    view	    and	    led	    to	    inefficiencies.	    It	    also	   emerged	    that	    in	    general	    the	    information	    systems	    within	    the	    construction	   industry	    support	    the	    traditional	    “T”	    based	    processes,	    and	    hence	    are	    not	    very	   effective	   at	   improving	   the	   efficiency	   of	   the	   core	   construction	   process.	   During	   the	   exploration	   of	   potential	   solutions,	   it	   emerged	   that	   the	   application	   of	   lean	    construction	    principles,	    tools	    and	    techniques	    can	    help	    improve	    the	   efficiency	   of	   the	   construction	   process,	   and	   techniques	   such	   as	   the	   Last	   Planner™	   system	   can	   help	   improve	   the	   efficiencies	   of	   the	   production	   management	   system.	   This	   mainly	   addresses	   the	   process	   management	   aspect	   in	   production.	   Similarly,	   it	   emerged	   that	   Building	   Information	   Modelling	   addresses	   many	   shortcomings	   of	   the	   traditional	   product	   modelling	   technologies	   such	   as	   2D	   and	   3D	   CAD.	   It	   also	   emerged	   that	   there	   are	   significant	   synergies	   between	   lean	   construction	   and	   BIM	   and	   that	   their	   simultaneous	   implementation	   could	   address	   many	   problems	   faced	   by	   the	   production	   management	   and	   control	   systems	   in	   construction.	   It	   can	   be	   concluded	   from	   the	   design,	   development	   and	   evaluation	   process	   that	   taking	   a	   highly	   iterative	   and	   incremental	   approach	   to	   developing	   a	   solution	   such	   as	   VisiLean	   is	   effective.	   An	   important	   aspect	   to	   consider	   is	   that	   although	   VisiLean	   is	   a	   technological	   solution,	   the	   people	   and	   process	   angle	   are	   equally	   if	   not	   more	   important,	    and	    that	    any	    software	    system	    design	    project	    should	    take	    into	   consideration	   these	   aspects	   throughout	   the	   design	   and	   development	   as	   opposed	   to	   only	   testing	   the	   final	   solution	   after	   the	   prototype	   has	   been	   developed.	   In	   conclusion,	   VisiLean	   can	   be	   considered	   a	   software	   framework	   based	   on	   which	   further	    production	    management	    functions	    can	    be	    added	    and	    a	    robust	    and	   comprehensive	    solution	    for	    an	    integrated	    construction	    management	    could	    be	   designed.	    It	    should	    be	    considered	    as	    a	    beginning	    of	    the	    next	    generation	    of	   software	   systems	   for	   construction	   industry,	   which	   address	   all	   TFV	   goals	   of	   the	   production	   system.

It	   was	   mentioned	   that	   their	   common	   practice	   is	   to	   divide	   the	   site	   in	   several	   locations	   (if	   it	   is	   not	   naturally	   divided	   in	   levels),	   to	   help	   identify	   where	   the	   tasks	    are	    located.	    This	    helps	    construction	    workers	    during	    planning	    and	   execution.	   • Several	    participants	    highlighted	    that	    they	    currently	    do	    not	    use	    lean	    or	   BIM	   so	   the	   system	   does	   not	   come	   across	   as	   relevant	   to	   them.	   • In	    general	    positive	    feedback	    was	    received,	    with	    follow	    up	    enquiries	    to	   trial	   the	   system	   on	   future	   projects.	   Workshop	   4	   –	   A	   Major	   Nuclear	   Energy	   Organisation	   1	   Location	   of	   workshop	   UoS,	   Manchester,	   UK	   2	   Type	   of	   organisations	   represented	   Client,	   Contractors,	   Design	   3	   Purpose	   Demonstration	   of	   research	   4	   Date	   of	   workshop	   06	   June	   2011	   Feedback	   from	   Workshop	   4	   • As	    the	    workshop	    being	    organised	    for	    a	    large	    client	    organisation,	    who	   maintain	   a	   very	   large	   asset	   (facility),	   there	   was	   an	   increased	   interest	   from	   the	   perspective	   of	   using	   the	   system	   post	   construction.	   It	   was	   highlighted	   that	   although	   the	   system	   is	   not	   being	   designed	   from	   that	   perspective,	   it	   has	   a	   potential	   to	   be	   used	   during	   facilities	   maintenance.	   • One	    of	    the	    users	    suggested	    that	    the	    future	    development	    should	    include	   features	   such	   as	   augmented	   reality	   to	   help	   locate	   hidden	   objects/services	   during	   facilities	   maintenance.	    	   • Linking	    of	    other	    rich	    media	    such	    as	    videos	    and	    photos	    to	    support	   activities	    such	    as	    snagging	    was	    suggested,	    along	    with	    integration	    with	   quality	   and	   safety	   management	   system.	    	   • Integration	    with	    other	    information	    management	    systems	    such	    as	   Knowledge	   Management	   and	   Document	   Management	   was	   suggested.	   Workshop	   5:	   A	   Large	   Construction	   Company	   1	   Nature/type	   Construction	   2	   Location	   of	   workshop	   UoS,	   Manchester,	   UK	   3	   Exposure	   to	   Lean	   Little	   4	   Exposure	   to	   BIM	   Yes.	    	   5	   Date	   of	   meeting	   14th	   October	   2011	   6	   Present	   in	   workshop	   Group	    BIM	    Manager,	    Project	   Managers,	    Procurement	    Manager,	   Quantity	    Surveyors,	    Site	    Supervisor,	   Group	   IT	   Manager	   Feedback	   from	   Workshop	   5	   The	    workshop	    was	    a	    part	    of	    a	    series	    of	    six	    workshops	    to	    help	    formulate	    the	   company’s	    BIM	    strategy.

Appendix	   B	   –	   Agile	   Programming	   Methods	   B.1	   Extreme	   Programming	   (XP)	   Introduced	    by	    Beck	    and	    Jeffries	    (Beck,	    1999a),	    XP	    is	    based	    the	    values	    of	   simplicity,	   communication,	   feedback	   and	   courage.	   In	   Table	   1,	   12	   rules	   of	   XP	   are	   described,	   which	   provide	   a	   simple	   and	   concise	   framework.	   Table	   1.	   Extreme	   Programming	   Framework	   • The planning game: At the start of each iteration, customers, managers and developers meet to define, estimate and prioritise requirements for the next release. The requirements are called “user stories” and are captured on “story cards” in a language understood by all parties. • Small releases: An initial version of the system is put into production after the first few iterations. Subsequently, working versions are put into production anywhere from every day to few days to every few weeks. • Metaphor: Customers, managers and developers construct a metaphor, or a set of metaphors after which to model the system. • Simple design: developers are urged to keep design as simple as possible • Tests: Developers work test-first, that is they write acceptance tests for their code before they write the code itself. Customers write functional tests for each iteration and at the end of each iteration, all tests should be run. • Refactoring: As developers work, the design should be evolved to keep it as simple as possible • Pair programming: Two developers sitting at the same machine write all code • Continuous integration: Developers integrate new code into the system as often as possible. All functional tests must still pass after integration or the new code is discarded • Collective ownership: The code is owned by al developers, and they make changes anywhere in the code at anytime they feel necessary. • On-site customer: A customer works with the development team at all times to answer questions, perform acceptance tests, and ensure that development is progressing as expected • 40 hour weeks: Requirements should be selected for each iteration such that no overtime work is needed • Open workspace: Developers work in a common workspace set up with individual workstation around the periphery and common development machines in the centre.	   The	   consensus	   from	   the	   practitioners	   is	   emerging	   that	   the	   strength	   of	   Extreme	   Programming	    is	    in	    combination	    of	    the	    12	    principles	    listed	    above	    rather	    than	   their	   individual	   implementation.	   It	   is	   also	   recommended	   to	   keep	   the	   minimum	   iteration	   cycle	   as	   2	   weeks.	   B.2	   Scrum	   Along	    with	    XP,	    Scrum	    is	    also	    one	    of	    the	    most	    popular	    Agile	    methods.	    It	    was	   described	   by	   Ken	   Schwaber	   in	   1996	   (Schwaber	   and	   Beedle,	   2002)	   as	   a	   process	   that	   “accepts	   that	   the	   development	   process	   is	   unpredictable”,	   formalising	   the	   “do	   what	    it	    takes”	    mentality,	    and	    has	    been	    since	    applied	    by	    a	    large	    number	    of	   independent	   software	   developers.	    	   The	    term	    Scrum	    is	    inspired	    from	    the	    sport	    rugby,	    where	    “Scrum	    occurs	    when	   players	   from	   each	   team	   huddle	   closely	   together	   in	   an	   attempt	   to	   advance	   down	   the	    playing	    field”	    (Highsmith,	    2002).	    There	    are	    three	    key	    stages	    in	    a	    Scrum	   project:	   • Pre-­‐sprint	    planning:	    Here,	    all	    the	    work	    that	    needs	    to	    be	    done	    on	    the	   software	    development	    is	    allocated	    to	    a	    “release	    backlog”.	    During	    this	   meeting,	    features	    and	    functionalities	    are	    selected	    from	    the	    release	   backlog	    and	    placed	    into	    the	    “sprint	    backlog”	    to	    be	    prioritised	    for	   completion	    during	    the	    next	    spring.	    It	    also	    identifies	    the	    reasons	    behind	   the	    performance	    of	    tasks	    and	    at	    which	    level	    of	    detail	    they	    need	    to	    be	   implemented	   (Highsmith,	   2002).	   • Sprint:	   Once	   the	   pre-­‐spring	   meeting	   is	   complete,	   the	   teams	   are	   allocated	   their	    spring	    backlog	    and	    asked	    to	    “spring	    to	    complete	    the	    backlog”	   (Schwaber,	    2009).	    Here,	    the	    tasks	    in	    the	    Sprint	    backlog	    are	    frozen	    and	   remain	   so	   for	   the	   duration	   of	   the	   Sprint.	   The	   priorities	   are	   set	   by	   the	   team	   members	   themselves	   and	   short	   daily	   meetings	   are	   organised	   to	   discuss	   progress.	   • Post-­‐sprint	    meeting:	    A	    post-­‐Sprint	    meeting	    is	    organised	    to	    discuss	    and	   analyse	    the	    progress	    and	    any	    obstacles,	    and	    also	    to	    demonstrate	    the	   current	   system.	   The	   key	   principles	   of	   Scrum	   can	   be	   summarised	   as	   (Schwaber,	   2009):	   • Small	   working	   teams	   that	   maximise	   communication,	   minimise	   overhead,	   and	   maximise	   sharing	   of	   tacit,	   informal	   knowledge	   • Adaptability	    to	    technical	    or	    marketplace	    (user/customer)	    changes	    to	   ensure	   the	   best	   possible	   product	   is	   produced	   
Frequent	    “builds”,	    or	    construction	    of	    executable,	    that	    can	    be	    inspected,	   adjusted,	   tested,	   documented	   and	   built	   on	   • Partitioning	    of	    work	    and	    team	    assignments	    into	    clean,	    low	    coupling	   partitions,	   or	   packets	   • Constant	   testing	   and	   documentation	   of	   a	   product	   as	   it	   is	   built	   • Ability	   to	   declare	   a	   product	   ‘done’	   whenever	   required	   (due	   to	   the	   reasons	   related	   to	   competition,	   cash	   flow,	   user/customer	   need,	   or	   deadline).	   B.3	   Crystal	   Methods	   and	   Feature	   Driven	   Development	   There	    are	    many	    other	    methods	    such	    as	    the	    Crystal	    Methods	    which	    were	   developed	   to	   address	   the	   poor	   communication	   during	   the	   product	   development	   stage	    in	    early	    1990s	    and	    the	    Feature	    Driven	    Development	    method	    which	    was	   developed	    in	    the	    late	    1990s	    (Paetsch	   et	   al.,	   2003).	   The	   Feature	   Driven	   system	   emphasises	    on	    defining	    a	    simple	    process	    and	    producing	    immediate	    output	    at	   each	    step	    that	    has	    value	    to	    all	    stakeholders.	    Similar	    to	    Scrum	    and	    Extreme	   Programming,	    both	    these	    methods	    also	    emphasise	    on	    the	    iterative	    and	   incremental	   cycle	   along	   with	   placing	   emphasis	   on	   collaboration.	   Key	   features	   for	   the	   Crystal	   Methods	   are	   (Paetsch	   et	   al.,	   2003):	   • Incremental	   time-­‐boxed	   delivery	   (Prototyping,	   Reviews)	   • Automated	   regression	   testing	   of	   functionalities	   (Testing)	   • Two	   user	   viewing	   per	   release	   (Review)	   • Workshops	   for	   product	   and	   methodology-­‐tuning	   at	   the	   beginning	   and	   in	   the	   middle	   of	   each	   increment	   (Review)	   Highsmith	   (2002)	   describe	   the	   core	   values	   of	   Feature	   Driven	   Development	   as:	   • A	    system	    for	    building	    systems	    is	    necessary	    in	    order	    to	    scale	    to	    larger	   projects	   • A	   simple,	   well-­‐defined	   process	   works	   best	   • Process	   steps	   should	   be	   logical	   and	   their	   worth	   immediately	   obvious	   to	   each	   team	   member	   • “Process	   Pride”	   can	   keep	   the	   real	   work	   from	   happening	   Good	   processes	   move	   to	   the	   background	   so	   the	   team	   members	   can	   focus	   on	   results	   • Short,	   iterative,	   feature-­‐driven	   life	   cycles	   are	   best	   B.4	   Dynamic	   Systems	   Development	   Method	   (DSDM)	   DSDM	   is	   a	   framework	   that	   is	   a	   formalisation	   of	   Rapid	   Application	   Development	   practices	   (Highsmith,	   2002).	   The	   DSDM	   lifecycle	   has	   six	   stages:	   • Pre-­‐project:	   The	   pre-­‐project	   phase	   indicates	   the	   readiness	   of	   the	   project,	   its	    finance	    and	    other	    resources	    needed	    to	    initiate	    and	    carry	    out	    the	   project.	   • Feasibility	    study:	    In	    DSDM	    it	    is	    stressed	    that	    the	    feasibility	    study	    stage	   should	   be	   short	   (preferably	   a	   few	   weeks),	   and	   help	   determine	   the	   right	   approach	   for	   the	   project.	   • Business	   study:	   The	   main	   aim	   of	   this	   phase	   is	   to	   leverage	   the	   knowledge	   from	   relevant	   team	   members,	   and	   organise	   facilitated	   workshops.	   It	   is	   a	   highly	    collaborative	    phase,	    where	    the	    end	    result	    is	    a	    definition	    of	    the	   business	   area,	   which	   identifies	   key	   users	   of	   the	   system,	   markets,	   and	   the	   business	   processes	   affected	   by	   the	   system.	   • Functional	    model	    iteration:	    One	    of	    the	    key	    early	    stages	    during	    system	   design,	    during	    functional	    model	    iteration	    a	    number	    of	    prototypes	    are	   developed	   using	   the	   high	   level	   requirements	   defined	   in	   previous	   stages.	   This	   phase	   and	   the	   subsequent	   phase	   of	   design	   and	   build	   iteration	   share	   a	   common	   process:	   o Identify	   why	   is	   to	   be	   produced	   o Agree	   how	   and	   when	   to	   do	   it	   o Create	   the	   new	   product	   o Check	    that	    it	    has	    been	    produced	    correctly	    (by	    reviewing	   documents,	    demonstrating	    a	    prototype	    or	    testing	    part	    of	    the	   system	   • Design	   and	   build	   iteration:	   In	   this	   phase,	   the	   prototypes	   developed	   in	   the	   previous	    phases	    are	    fully	    developed,	    and	    tested	    to	    deliver	    a	    working	   system	   to	   the	   users	   Implementation:	    In	    this	    phase	    the	    system	    is	    implemented	    and	    put	    into	   use.	    A	    review	    is	    carried	    out	    to	    identify	    whether	    the	    system	    meets	    user	   requirements,	    and	    if	    there	    is	    any	    additional	    work	    to	    be	    done.	    The	   previous	   stages	   are	   iterated	   if	   any	   additional	   work	   is	   to	   be	   carried	   out.	   • Post-­‐project:	   During	   this	   phase,	   on-­‐going	   maintenance	   and	   updates	   to	   the	   system	   are	   carried	   out.	   There	   could	   be	   a	   number	   of	   variations	   of	   these	   methods	   and	   other	   lesser	   known	   methods	   in	   use	   to	   facilitate	   system	   development.	    	   Cohen	   et	   al.	   (2003)	   compare	   selected	   agile	   methods	   and	   highlight	   key	   difference.	    	   The	   authors	   highlight	   that	   the	   Scrum	   method	   of	   agile	   development	   is	   suitable	   for	   use	    in	    small	    teams	    (1-­‐7),	    and	    has	    a	    relatively	    quicker	    iteration	    cycle,	    where	   outputs	   can	   be	   inspected,	   and	   adjusted.	   References	   Beck,	   K.

Appendix	   C	   Additional	   VisiLean	   Images	   This	   appendix	   provides	   high	   resolution	   screen	   shots	   of	   VisiLean	   prototype	   describing	   various	   functions	   of	   system	   for	   improved	   clarity.	   Figure	   1	   shows	   the	   phase	   planning	   screen	   shot	   with	   approximately	   three	   months	   duration	   of	   tasks	   shown.	   One	   key	   feature	   is	   visualization	   of	   different	   task	   statuses	   from	   production	   planning	   and	   control	   perspective.	   For	   example,	   the	   image	   shows	   the	   “prepare	   grading”	   task	   that	   is	   not	   ready	   as	   the	   resource	   allocated	   to	   it,	   “JCB	   Backhoe”,	   is	   not	   available	   yet.	   Resource	   constraints	   can	   be	   added	   either	   in	   the	   Phase	   or	   Lookahead	   planning	   stage.	   	   	   Figure	   1.	   Phase	   Planning	   in	   VisiLean.	   Figure	   2	   shows	   tasks	   within	   a	   two	   week	   Lookahead	   planning	   window.	   The	   main	   goal	   is	   that	   once	   these	   tasks	   are	   selected	   in	   the	   Lookahead	   plan,	   both	   the	   teams	   (Team	   A	   and	   Team	   B)	   will	   list	   all	   the	   constraints	   associated	   with	   each	   of	   the	   tasks.	   Within	   the	   next	   two	   weeks	   they	   will	   have	   the	   opportunity	   to	   remove	   the	   constraints	   and	   get	   the	   tasks	   ready	   for	   the	   weekly	   execution	   work	   plan.	   Only	   those	   tasks	   with	   “ready”	   status	   can	   then	   be	   released	   to	   the	   weekly	   plan.	   	   	   Figure	   2.	   Lookahead	   planning	   screen,	   showing	   tasks	   within	   a	   two	   week	   window.	   Figure	   3	   shows	   the	   weekly	   work	   plan	   where	   the	   selected	   task	   is	   ready	   as	   the	   single	   constraint	   that	   is	   associated	   with	   it	   is	   marked	   as	   available.	   Also	   note	   that	   the	   task	   pop-­‐up	   in	   the	   model	   view	   shows	   a	   green	   “ready”	   symbol	   against	   the	   element	   in	   the	   model.	   During	   the	   execution	   week,	   the	   teams	   will	   use	   the	   start,	   stop	   and	   complete	   buttons	   to	   indicate	   the	   current	   status	   of	   the	   task.	   	   	   Figure	   3.	   Screen	   shot	   showing	   a	   weekly	   work	   plan.	   Figure	   4	   shows	   the	   task	   filtering	   during	   planning	   to	   facilitate	   selection	   of	   tasks	   based	   on	   various	   criteria	   such	   as	   organisation,	   role,	   space,	   status	   and	   date,	   etc.	   Filtering	   will	   be	   used	   during	   the	   collaborative	   planning	   meetings	   to	   visualise	   a	   selection	   of	   tasks,	   which	   can	   then	   be	   reviewed	   and	   appropriate	   action	   taken.	   	   	   	   	   Figure	   4.	   Task	   filtering	   during	   planning	   in	   VisiLean.	   	   		   	   Figure	   5	   shows	   the	   top-­‐level	   system	   architecture	   and	   is	   a	   high	   resolution	   version	   of	   Figure	   39,	   which	   was	   shown	   in	   Chapter	   5.	   	   Figure	   5	   -­‐	   VisiLean	   System	   Architecture	   (high	   resolution)
