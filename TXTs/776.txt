Abstract. Building accidents and fatalities are prevalent, especially in rising nations like Ghana, despite rapid technical developments. Weak regulations, training, and change resistance typically undermine traditional safety measures. This study aimed to identify potential obstacles that prevent the implementation of artificial intelligence (AI) in construction health and safety in Ghana. A survey research approach was employed to get the study population, which consisted of 110 construction experts made up of project managers, site engineers, skilled workers, and safety officers complete the questionnaire. Data analysis included descriptive statistics, chi-square, and regression. According to varied demographic responses, AI increases design and engineering, safety and security, and human resources efficiency, decision-making, and safety. Lack of innovation culture, training, and regulation harms health and safety. Using AI promises to overcome these hurdles by minimising risks, improving worker wellbeing, and safe work environment. The Ghanaian industry study focus and small sample size may prejudice, as the limitations of the study. Samples must be larger and more diversified to generalise. The practical implication is that Ghanaian builders may use the study’s findings. Understanding AI’s potential and limitations helps them develop AI solutions and problem-solving methodologies. Safety, cost, and worker well-being can improve. The successful integration of AI in construction health and safety can affect society. AI can reduce workplace accidents and improve productivity, well-being, and healthcare costs. This work adds to the growing body of knowledge on AI’s building safety applications in emerging economies like Ghana. It identifies environmental restrictions and enables governments, industry leaders, and researchers to develop and implement AI solutions.

issues, and productivity and labour shortages (Hire et al., 2022). AI techniques, such as machine learning, knowledge-based systems, computer vision, robotics, and optimisation, have been successfully applied in other industries to improve profitability, efficiency, safety, and security (Abioye et al., 2021). In the construction industry, AI applications can be used for activity monitoring, risk management, resource, and waste optimisation, and safety checks of ladders (Abioye et al., 2021; Majumder, 2022). AI can help in the pre-use stage of ladder safety by assessing the structural rigidity of the ladder and reducing accidents and hazards (Prabha et al., 2021). Additionally, AI can be integrated into Real Estate 4.0 to address health and safety issues in the real estate sector, making it safer for workers. Overall, AI offers opportunities to improve health and safety performance in construction and to enhance the industry’s overall efficiency and productivity. However, despite the potential benefits of AI in construction health and safety, numerous challenges remain, such as the need for large amounts of data and the need for workers to be trained in the use of AI systems (Abioye et al., 2021).  
   The application of artificial intelligence (AI) in construction health and safety is very important. The construction industry is known for its poor safety and health, leading to accidents and fatalities. AI-driven techniques can effectively manage safety issues and reduce the number of accidents (Hire et al., 2022). Immersive technologies, including AI, have emerged as viable solutions for addressing occupational safety and health (OSH) performance in construction. These technologies have been applied to hazard identification, safety training, risk assessment, and safety design (Babalola et al., 2023). Technological innovations are crucial for ensuring OHS in the construction sector, which is prone to injury and death. Various technologies have been developed and applied in the construction industry to enhance OHS, contributing to the widespread use of such technologies (Yıldız & Yılmaz, 2022). AI techniques have the potential to address safety and productivity issues in construction, enabling the implementation of industrialised concepts and removing personnel from hazardous environments (Hatami et al., 2022). Automation in safety planning, including the application of AI, has been extensively studied, highlighting the need for further research and the challenges faced in integrating AI into construction safety planning (Chen & Chan, 2022). The implementation of AI in construction health and safety in Ghana faces several potential challenges and limitations. One major challenge is the lack of comprehensive national occupational health and safety (OHS) policies, which hinder the effective regulation and enforcement of health and safety standards (Kheni & Afatsawu, 2022).  
   Another challenge is the fragmented nature of the construction industry, resulting in difficulties with data acquisition and retention, which are essential for AI implementation (Boakye et al., 2022). Additionally, the construction industry in Ghana lacks adequate on-site resources, including logistics and well-defined frameworks for regulating health and safety standards (Regona et al., 2022). Furthermore, the manual nature of the construction environment and the unique characteristics of each project pose challenges for AI implementation, such as catering to one-off designs and sporadic demands for work (Boadu et al., 2021a). These challenges must be addressed to fully harness the potential of AI in improving construction health and safety in Ghana. This study aimed to identify potential obstacles that prevent the implementation of AI in construction health and safety in Ghana. This study aims to explore the current technologies essential for health and safety in the Ghanaian construction industry, examine the characteristics of the construction industry in Ghana and their implications for health and safety, and investigate the potential to expand AI use in the Ghanaian construction industry. 
1. STATE OF HEALTH AND SAFETY AND AI IN THE GHANAIAN CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY 
   The current state of health and safety in the Ghanaian construction industry is characterised by a moderate level of utilisation of health and safety technologies, including wearable safety devices, geographic information systems, sensing technologies, virtual reality, and BIM (Agyekum et al., 2022). However, there are barriers to the adoption of these technologies, such as excessive costs, weak innovation culture, lack of continuous training, resistance to change, and lack of governmental support and regulations (Osei‐Asibey et al., 2021; Mustapha, 2016). Accidents and hazards in the industry are caused by various factors, including a lack of safety and health policies, inadequate training, a shortage of safety specialists, and inadequate risk assessments (Boadu et al., 2021a). The enforcement of occupational health and safety standards also faces challenges, such as poor OHS enforcement and institutional constraints (Bang & Nemade, 2023). Additionally, the health and safety culture in the Ghanaian construction industry is at the first level, the pathological stage, with safety not considered a key business risk (Williams et al., 2019; Mustapha, 2016). 
   Research on artificial intelligence (AI) in construction health and safety in Ghana has revealed several key findings. One study found a lack of health and safety management at all levels of the construction chain, with poor culture and attitudes towards health and safety among construction workers, supervisors, and companies (Aasonaa, 2023). Another study emphasised the need to decolonise occupational safety and health (OSH) research and practice to improve safety culture in non-Western countries, such as Ghana (Sherratt & Aboagye‐Nimo, 2022). Additionally, factors influencing safety performance in the construction industry were identified, with management support and commitment to safety performance being the most influential (Boakye et al., 2022). A study of small- and mediumsized enterprise (SME) contractors in Ghana identified safety culture indicators that can improve health and safety performance, providing a basis for a positive construction safety culture (Adzivor et al., 2022). Bamfo-Agyei (2017) focused on the safe use of tower cranes and highlighted the importance of competent personnel and adequate training in preventing accidents. Finally, health and safety considerations are given low priority in the procurement of public sector projects in Ghana, highlighting the need for improved health and safety (H&S) practices in procurement decisions (Boadu et al., 2021b). 
   Artificial intelligence (AI) techniques have the potential to address safety and productivity issues in the construction industry by removing personnel from hazardous environments and implementing industrialised concepts (Hatami et al., 2022). However, the adoption of AI techniques in construction remains limited (Boadu & Wang et al., 2021). In Ghana, the enforcement of occupational health and safety (OHS) standards faces several challenges, including poor enforcement and institutional constraints (Phinias, 2023). Implementing leading indicators in the construction industry can provide benefits, such as accident prevention, compliance with regulations, and early warning systems; however, it also presents challenges, such as training and communication, time and cost, and worker involvement (Simpson & Sam, 2019). The perception of H&S management practices on construction sites in Ghana is generally positive, but the findings are limited to the study areas (Chen & Chan, 2022). Automation in safety planning in construction has been studied extensively, with a focus on permanent structures, the need for further research on temporary structures, and the application of artificial intelligence. 
2. TECHNOLOGIES ESSENTIAL FOR HEALTH AND SAFETY IN THE GHANAIAN CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY 
   Technologies essential for health and safety in the Ghanaian construction industry include wearable safety devices, geographic information systems, sensing technologies, virtual reality, and BIM (Agyekum et al., 2022). Construction professionals in Ghana moderately utilise these technologies (Osei‐Asibey et al., 2021). However, there are barriers to the adoption of these technologies, such as excess costs related to acquiring new technologies, weak innovation culture, lack of continuous training in the workforce, resistance to change with the ageing workforce, and little or no governmental support and regulations (Nnaji & Karakhan, 2020). The adoption and implementation of innovative solutions, including technology, can improve construction safety performance (Williams et al., 2019).  
   The use of technology for safety and health management in construction has gained attention; however, there is still resistance to its continuous use (Dobrucali et al., 2023). The state of health and safety culture in the Ghanaian construction industry is at the first level, the pathological stage, indicating the need for improvement. Integrating technology into health and safety can enhance safety performance during construction (Mustapha, 2016). Zhou (2013) highlights various technologies, including ICT, sensor-based technology, 3S technology, RFID, and virtual reality, that have been adopted for construction safety management. Kheni (2008) focuses on health and safety practices in construction SMEs in Ghana, revealing a lack of proactive practices but identifying specific practices associated with firm characteristics. Boadu (2020) explored the characteristics of the construction industry in developing countries, including Ghana, and their implications for health and safety management. 
 
3. METHODOLOGY 
   A comprehensive literature review was conducted to gather insights into the use of artificial intelligence (AI) techniques in the construction industry. Relevant publications were sourced using keywords, such as ‘AI’, ‘construction safety’, ‘productivity’, and ‘enforcement’ across databases including Google Scholar, JSTOR, and Science Direct. A structured questionnaire was developed after the literature review (Sarantakos, 2005). The questionnaire survey was aimed to gauge the perception and understanding of AI applications in construction health and safety, the challenges in enforcing occupational health and safety (OHS) standards, and the potential to expand AI use in this context, specifically within the Ghanaian construction industry. A pilot study was conducted to test the validity and reliability of the questionnaire. The questionnaire consisted of close-ended questions and used a five-point Likert scale for respondents to express their level of agreement or disagreement with certain assertions related to the research area. The target population was 110, including a stratified sample of construction experts, project managers, site engineers, skilled workers, and safety officers working in Ghana using a survey research approach (Akomah et al., 2020). However, because the population was small, the entire population was used as the sample size in this study.  
   To ensure a high response rate, the questionnaire was distributed online and in person. Data was analysed using descriptive statistics and the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS). Frequencies and percentages were used to summarise the data, while inferential statistics, chi-square tests, and regression analysis were utilised to explore the relationships between variables. The insights derived from this analysis were then cross-verified with findings from the literature review to present a comprehensive understanding of the status and potential of AI applications in construction safety management in Ghana.

6. URRENT STATE OF HEALTH AND SAFETY IN THE GHANAIAN CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY 
   Table 2 paints a concerning picture of the current state of health and safety in the Ghanaian construction industry. Respondents identified weak innovation culture (mean = 4.45), lack of continuous training (mean = 4.51), and resistance to change (mean = 4.53) as major impediments to progress. These factors, with standard deviations hovering around 0.65, suggest a consistent level of concern across these areas. Further, incompetent personnel (mean = 4.57) and poor enforcement (mean = 4.43) add to the challenges, while the high mean for lack of comprehensive OHS policies (mean = 4.25) highlights a critical gap in regulatory frameworks. While concerns seem evenly distributed across several factors, some have higher deviations. Time and cost (mean = 4.43, SD = 0.81) indicate greater variability in viewpoints, suggesting this may be a point of contention or one where some perceive it as a significant hurdle while others do not. Similarly, worker involvement (mean = 4.56, SD = 0.72) reveals some variance in opinions on its impact on overall health and safety. The findings underscore the multifaceted nature of challenges in Ghana’s construction industry.  
   While focusing on innovation, training, and OHS policies is crucial, addressing individual factors like personnel competence and enforcement alongside concerns like cost and worker involvement will be vital in creating a safer and more efficient construction environment.

   The data in Table 3 reveal a concerning picture of construction workers’ occupational health and safety (OHS) challenges. Respondents identified a multitenancy with all variables exceeding a mean score of 4 on a 5-point scale, indicating significant concern. Lack of awareness of OHS standards emerged as the top challenge, with a mean of 4.56, followed closely by corruption (4.57) and weak OHS enforcement institutions (4.55). The data also highlights systemic issues like lack of political will (4.53) and weak legal systems (4.54) contributing to the pervasiveness of these challenges. While the mean scores suggest a general perception of significant challenges across the board, the standard deviations and variances provide further insights.  
   Variables like pressure to meet deadlines and budgets (SD = 0.614, Var = 0.377) and hazardous work conditions (SD = 0.586, Var = 0.344) exhibit lower variance, indicating a more consistent concern among respondents. Conversely, language barriers (SD = 0.736, Var = 0.542) and stigma associated with reporting injuries  (SD = 0.665, Var = 0.442) show higher variance, suggesting these issues may be more prevalent in specific sub-groups within the construction workforce. The data underscores the need for comprehensive and multi-pronged interventions to address the diverse OHS challenges plaguing the construction industry. From raising awareness and strengthening enforcement to fostering a culture of safety and improving legal frameworks, concerted efforts are crucial to protect the health and well-being of construction workers.

THE POTENTIAL TO EXPAND AI USE TO IMPROVE CONSTRUCTION HEALTH AND SAFETY IN GHANA 
   Respondents in the Ghanaian construction industry expressed a positive outlook on the potential for expanding AI use across various aspects of their work. The data from Table 4 shows that, on average, respondents rated the potential for AI to improve various areas with scores ranging from 4.28 (supplier management) to 4.66 (design and engineering), with a mean score of 4.47 across all areas. This indicates a general agreement that AI can benefit diverse construction activities significantly. Looking at specific areas, the highest mean scores were recorded for design and engineering (4.66), safety and security (4.55), and human resources (4.53).  
   These high scores suggest that respondents see great potential for AI in automating tasks, improving decision-making, and enhancing safety in these critical areas. Additionally, most areas' relatively low standard deviations (ranging from 0.57 to 0.83) indicate a consistent positive sentiment towards AI use. However, there are some areas where the potential for AI seems less clear. For example, areas like marketing and sales (4.29) and customer relationship management (CRM) (4.31) received lower mean scores, suggesting that respondents are less certain about the benefits of AI in these more human-centric areas.  
   Additionally, the high standard deviation for risk management (0.75) suggests some variation in opinion on how AI can effectively address this complex issue. Finally, the data gives a promising picture of AI integration's future in the Ghanaian construction industry. Respondents recognise the potential for AI to improve efficiency, safety, and decision-making across a wide range of tasks. While some areas offer greater clarity than others, the overall positive sentiment suggests a strong foundation for further exploration and development of AI solutions tailored to the specific needs of the Ghanaian construction sector.

   As per the analysis of the hypothesis, the researcher employed multiple linear regression and analysis at 95 % confidence intervals. The analysis showed a good model fit: F (3.106) = 68.87; p < 001; Adj R2 = 0.661 and R2 = 0.661. The analyses show that AI positively impacted current technologies essential for using construction health and safety within the Ghanaian construction industry (β = 0.058; t = 0.708; p < 001). Hence, Hypothesis 1 was accepted. Table 5 shows AI had a positive impact on the current state of health and safety challenges within the Ghanaian construction industry (β = 0.021; t = 0.208, p < 001), indicating that 
Hypothesis 2 was accepted. Also, applying AI technology to improve health and safety procedures has much to offer the Ghanaian construction sector. The industry may take a more proactive and preventative stance by utilising real-time monitoring, predictive analytics, and immersive training experiences. Despite some obstacles, artificial intelligence (AI) can completely transform construction health and safety in Ghana, eventually improving worker wellbeing and fostering the industry's longterm success.

8. SUMMARY OF FINDINGS 
   This study investigates the potential of AI to improve health and safety in Ghana’s construction industry. Construction experts, project managers, site engineers, skilled workers, and safety officers working in Ghana were the respondents (mostly male, aged 26–30, with bachelor’s degree and 2–5 years of experience) who see strong potential for AI across various areas, with design and engineering, safety and security, and human resources receiving the highest scores (4.66, 4.55, and 4.53, respectively). However, marketing and sales and CRM scored lower (4.29 and 4.31), demonstrating some uncertainty about AI’s benefits in human-centric areas. Technology-wise, wearable safety devices, 3S technology, and sensing technologies were deemed most essential for health and safety (means above 4.7 on a 5-point scale).  
   Major challenges identified include weak innovation culture, lack of continuous training, resistance to change, and incompetent personnel. OHS challenges revealed a lack of awareness, corruption and weak enforcement of OHS policy as key concerns. These findings concur with the findings of Hire et al. (2022) and Babalola et al. (2023). Statistical analysis confirmed AI's positive impact on both essential technologies and current health and safety practices. Despite these challenges, the study finds a positive correlation between AI use and improved CHS. Linear regression analysis confirms the positive impact of AI on both essential technologies for CHS (β = 0.058; t = 0.708; p < 001) and the current state of CHS (β = 0.021; t = 0.208; p < 001). This suggests that AI can offer real-time monitoring, predictive analytics, and immersive training experiences, paving the way for a safer and more proactive construction environment in Ghana. 
CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 
   This study concludes that AI holds immense potential to transform construction health and safety in Ghana. Construction industry professionals (project managers, site engineers, skilled workers, and safety officers) working in Ghana recognised the benefits of AI in improving efficiency, decision-making, and safety across various tasks, particularly in design, engineering, and human resources. This finding contributes to the growing body of knowledge surrounding AI’s applicability in construction safety, specifically within developing economies like Ghana.  
   Additionally, the study identifies key challenges hindering optimal health and safety practices, such as weak innovation culture, lack of training, and regulatory deficiencies. By addressing these roadblocks and leveraging AI’s potential, the Ghanaian construction industry can take a proactive approach to prevent hazards, improve worker well-being, and foster a safer work environment.  
   This, in turn, will contribute to societal benefits by reducing human suffering, promoting workforce retention, and boosting the construction sector's overall productivity and competitiveness. Further research focused on developing culturally sensitive AI solutions tailored to the specific needs of Ghana’s construction workforce will be crucial for maximising the positive impact of this technology and achieving a safer, more sustainable future for the industry.
