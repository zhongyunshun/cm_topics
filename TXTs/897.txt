The effect of resilience on performance and job satisfaction among construction managers in Saudi Arabia
Deepanjana Varshney 	| Nirbhay K. Varshney
To compete in an often turbulent business environment, organizations seek the stability that comes from a resilient workforce. Resilient employees are able to adapt when confronted with change and to devise solutions to even the most challenging problems. They bounce back from disappointment and move steadily forward. Moreover, they tend to be satisfied with their jobs, demonstrate effective team- and capacity-building skills, and can maintain their energy despite stressful situations. To assess the relationship between resiliency and job satisfaction and the impact of resiliency on three keys aspects employee performance, researchers polled 126 managers in Saudi Arabia’s construction industry. Their findings show that resilience mediates the relationship between job satisfaction and both adaptive performance and contextual performance, but does not, however, affect task performance.
   
1 | 	INTRODUCTION
Globalization, stiff competition, and ever-changing developments in technology have made the nature of work unpredictable, dynamic, and market-focused (Allvin, Aronsson, Hagström, Johansson, & Lundberg, 2011). To survive, many firms have been compelled to necessitate massive restructuring through downsizing, mergers, and acquisitions, often within a short period of time (De Meuse, Marks, & Dai, 2011). In some instances, firms have had to simultaneously grapple with the effects of environmental disasters, which presented additional challenges requiring adaptability in strategic planning (Lee, Vargo, & Seville, 2013; Reser & Swim, 2011). To deal with such upheavals in the business environment, organizations must be flexible and agile, yet judicious (Lengnick-Hall, Beck, & Lengnick-Hall, 2011).
   Not surprisingly, the concept of resilience has been widely discussed in the business sector during these challenging times. While resilience has aptly been described as the ability to recover from adversity (Wagnild, 2009), it is also perceived as a positive personality trait that improves individual capacity to bounce back from adversity and moderate the adverse effects of stress (Wagnild & Young, 1993). Other researchers have found that resilient individuals experience positive emotions even in high-stress environments (Tugade & Fredrickson, 2004).
   Over the last 10 years, the government of Saudi Arabia has sought to improve the nation’s resiliency by reducing its dependence on oil revenues, which fluctuate with price and worldwide demand. In seeking to make rapid economic progress, the country faces various sociocultural challenges. Orthodox Islamic principles, a tribal family system, and the authority-oriented Ottoman system of government have clashed with rapid socioeconomic changes brought on by industrial development, technological progress, and Western influence (Varshney, 2014). In this scenario, the government of Saudi Arabia has embarked on a Saudization program that gradually seeks to replace foreign workers with local ones. At the same time, however, there is a skill shortage among both young Saudi graduates and the senior segment of the population (Varshney, 2015).

The nation has firmly set its sights on transitioning to a knowledge-based economy, as reflected in the spending patterns of the Ninth Five-Year Development Plan. The future vision of the Saudi economy (up to 2024) focuses on continuous long-term socioeconomic development and emphasizes the strategic dimensions adopted by the government (Ramady, 2013). For instance, there have been ongoing initiatives to establish university technological innovation centers, research centers, and technological incubators besides academic universities (Ministry of Economy and Planning of Saudi Arabia, 2010).
2 | THE CHALLENGE OF DEFINING RESILIENCE
To date there is no standard definition of human resilience (Herrman, Stewart, Diaz-Granados, Berger, Jackson, & Yuen, 2011; Luthar, Cicchetti, & Becker, 2000). Although the numerous descriptions that have been proposed over the years differ widely across specializations, they serve to enhance overall understanding of this characteristic (Rossi, Meurs, & Perrewé, 2013).
   An early conceptualization of resilience was developed during clinical studies of children and adolescents in the 1970s and 1980s (Anthony, 1974; Garmezy, 1974, 1981; Rutter, 1979; Werner & Smith, 1982). Wagnild and Young (1993) defined resilience as “a personality characteristic that moderates the negative effects of stress and promotes adaption” (p. 165). In their study of 74 works associated with resilience, Bhamra, Danie, and Burnard (2012) concluded that individual, organizational, communal, and ecological aspects of resilience have dominated research over the past 40 years. Researchers have primarily analyzed it as a behavior.
   Resilience has been defined as the capacity to not only recover after an adverse experience, but also to sustain a stable psychological position amid evolving situations (Seery, 2011). It has also been pointed out that individuals with low resilience have been found to experience greater psychological affliction following a setback than those having a high degree of resilience (Faircloth, 2017). Resilience has also been viewed as an attitude, a dynamic, and a result (Olivos, 2014). According to Cyrulnik (2011), individual resilience is a process—refined through various life cycle experiences, especially negative ones—anchored in a motive and hope. Motive refers to the positive way in which the individual perceives adversity; hope signals a belief in success at the end of the struggle. Other researchers have explained resilience as employees’ ability to successfully perform their jobs with available organizational resources and support despite adverse circumstances (Näswall, Kuntz, & Malinen, 2015).
   Numerous studies have focused on dispositional resilience (Block & Kremen, 1996; Connor & Davidson, 2003), including the traits of self-efficacy, optimism, hopefulness, and hardiness (Malik, 2013). Since it has been argued that resilience can be developed or demonstrated when an individual faces difficulties, some maintain that resilience cannot be an inherent trait (Rutter, 2007). Previous research has highlighted the contributions to resilience of external protective factors, such as family, culture, and community (Bonanno & Mancini, 2008; Werner & Smith, 1982), which can help alleviate the strain of hardship (Masten & Garmezy, 1985).
  Lengnick-Hall et al. (2011) emphasize the development of new skills and capabilities that can be effectively used by individuals to succeed during difficult times. Waite and Richardson (2004) show how an individual experiences difficulties and (after some deliberation) gains the determination to grow and emerge practically unscathed from the ordeal. In some instances, adversity can lead individuals to scale new heights and foster their development (Hodliffe, 2014).
   Youssef and Luthans (2007) described resilience as a “proactive element,” while other researchers have stressed that it can be developed through the use of strategies that make individuals more flexible and mentally strong when presented with change (Avey, Luthans, & Jensen, 2009; Tugade & Fredrickson, 2004; Tugade, Fredrickson, & Feldman Barrett, 2004). Similarly, Howard and Irving (2013) found that the development of leadership is molded by a focused approach to adversity. They posit that a person effectively builds competency by facing challenges and finding the means to overcome them. According to Reivich and Shatte (2002), resilience enables individuals to overcome the obstacles of childhood, handle common adversities, bounce back from a major setback, and reach out to others to maximize the potential of all concerned. Resiliency is of critical importance to the career of anyone in a leadership role, for it is essential to ongoing development and success.
   According to Reivich and Shatte (2002), resilient individuals have a task-oriented coping style, a deeply held belief in their ability to control the outcomes of their own life, and the capacity to use connections to others as a way to cope with adversity. The characteristics that can help individuals adjust to hardship include positive self-esteem, hardiness, strong coping skills, a sense of coherence, self-efficacy, optimism, strong social resources, adaptability, risk-taking, low fear of failure, determination, perseverance, and a high tolerance of uncertainty (O’Leary, 1998; Patterson et al., 2002).
Resiliency is of critical importance to the career of anyone in a leadership role, for it is essential to ongoing development and success.
   Resilient leaders foster an effective professional work environment, excellent communication, and acceptance at all levels of the institution (Hoffman, 2004). By nurturing resilient employees, organizations create future resilient leaders capable of assuming challenging decision-making positions. Ideally, these leaders will carve out a bright future for their organization in the face of any crisis. Organizations ultimately can be characterized as resilient if they manage to get back to the status quo after experiencing adversity, or get ahead through consistent improvement or high performance (Patterson, Patterson, & Collins, 2002). As with resilience in individuals, the concept reflects an ability to survive, bounce back, and even prosper in both good times and bad.
By nurturing resilient employees, organizations create future resilient leaders capable of assuming challenging decision-making positions.
   Given the nonlinear nature of the concept of resilience and the use of both subjective and objective factors to assess it, it is difficult to determine the relationship between resilience outcomes and processes (Graber, Pichon, & Carabine, 2015). It can be argued that resilience represents the capacity to adapt to certain conditions.
2.1 | 	Work performance and resilience
Employees’ performance on the job determines their career development and success. Not surprisingly, research has shown that high performers are more readily promoted within an organization and have better career opportunities available to them than low performers do (Van Scooter, Motowidlo, & Cross, 2000). Described as “actions and behaviors that are under the control of the individual that contribute to the goals of the organization” (Rotundo & Sackett, 2002, p. 66), work performance is multidimensional (Campbell, 1990) and can be categorized into:
• Task performance, which entails job-related behaviors and activities that provide support for the company’s technical aspects or the maintenance of processes and coordination functions (Borman & Motowidlo, 1993; Motowidlo, Borman, & Schmit, 1997).
• Contextual performance, which includes the behavior that sustains the wider psychological and social settings in which task performance occurs (Borman & Motowidlo, 1993).
• Adaptive performance, which is the extent to which an individual adapts to changes in work systems or work roles (Griffin, Neal, & Parker, 2007). It includes solving problems creatively; dealing with uncertain or unpredictable work situations; learning new tasks, technologies, and procedures; and adapting to other individuals, cultures, or physical surroundings (Koopmans et al., 2011).
  Organizations require high-performing employees to achieve their objectives (Sonnentag & Frese, 2005), and employees’ capacity for resilience can significantly enhance their performance. Research has revealed a positive correlation between resilience and job performance (Kumari & Sangwan, 2015). Moreover, resilience has been found to decrease the negative impact of perceived job insecurity on organizational commitment and job satisfaction, which are associated with job performance (Rus & Baban, 2013). Additionally, research has also shown that highly resilient employees have the ability to confront an aggressive environment (Luthans, Avolio, Avey, & Norman, 2007). It has also been demonstrated that resilience, along with related variables, can improve performance and productivity and an individual’s cognitive flexibility to adapt to change with composure, accomplishment, and accountability (Spreitzer & Cameron, 2011).
   Research has indicated a positive relationship between employee resilience and performance, while highlighting the significance of developing resilient employees (Luthans, Avolio, Walumbwa, & Li, 2005). Corroborating a positive relationship between resilience and organizational results, additional research found that resilience was related to enhanced profitability, increased job satisfaction, and commitment to the firm (Luthans, Youssef, & Avolio, 2007).
2.2 | 	Job satisfaction and resilience
Job satisfaction, which can be defined as a positive feeling about one’s job (Robbins, Ford, & Tetrick, 2012), has been linked to increased productivity (McKenna, 2006). Research has also shown there to be a significant correlation between resilience and job satisfaction (Murphy, 2014). Facing difficulties with resiliency enables individuals to effectively handle challenges while achieving their goals (Masten, 2001; Masten, Long, Kuo, McCormick, & Desjardins, 2009). The resulting sense of accomplishment leads, in turn, to job satisfaction (Badran & Youssef-Morgan, 2015). In addition, recent research has found that an employee’s intent to remain—a construct in which job satisfaction and expected turnover overlap—has a statistically significant relationship with resilience (Hudgins, 2016).
3 | 	ANALYZING THE ROLE OF RESILIENCE AS A MEDIATOR
The extent to which employee resilience is related to outcomes such as job satisfaction and performance can be identified by examining the potential results of employee resilience. Resilient employees show improvement more quickly and efficiently than employees with low levels of resilience and are more accommodating and receptive to organizational changes (Shin, Taylor, & Seo, 2012). By perceiving change as an opportunity for growth and development, resilient employees demonstrate more engagement with their work than employees with low levels of resilience do (Hodliffe, 2014). When employees experience a high level of achievement and feel involved and appreciated, their degree of job satisfaction increases (Hagedorn, 2000). This leads to a virtuous cycle, as highly satisfied employees tend to be more engaged in their job.
   Additional research supports the assertion that employee resilience adds value to key performance drivers (Näswall, Kuntz, & Malinen, 2015). Furthermore, there has also been research on the impact of job engagement, job satisfaction, and turnover intentions on organizational success and productivity (Baumruk, 2004; Loke, 2001). Various studies demonstrate the mediating effect of resilience on different attitudes and outcomes. Lees (2009) found that resilience fully mediated the relationship between task-focused coping and engagement. Hodliffe (2014) noted that employee resilience has a significant association with learning culture, empowering leadership, job engagement, job satisfaction, and turnover intention. In addition, the results demonstrated that employee resilience has a mediating effect on the relationships between learning culture and job engagement and job satisfaction, between empowering leadership and job engagement, and between job satisfaction and turnover intentions.
   The research on resilience and job performance raises the following questions:
• Does job satisfaction have a positive relationship with resilience?
• How does resilience mediate the dimensions of individual work performance (task, adaptive, and contextual performance) and job satisfaction?
   The following hypotheses are illustrated in the research model shown in Exhibit 1:
Hypothesis 1 Job satisfaction has a positive relationship with resilience. Hypothesis 2 Resilience mediates the relationship between job satisfaction and task performance.
EXHIBIT 1 	Research model

Hypothesis 3 Resilience mediates the relationship between job satisfaction and adaptive performance.
Hypothesis 4 Resilience mediates the relationship between job satisfaction and contextual performance.
   To test these hypotheses, researchers administered a structured questionnaire to 300 construction industry managers in Saudi Arabia. Of these, 126 usable responses were received, for a response rate of 42%. As outlined in Exhibit 2, all the respondents were male; 60.3% had graduate degrees and 31.7% had taken on postgraduate studies. Almost half the respondents were 46 to 55 years of age and had 11 to 15 years of experience (47.6% and 46.8%, respectively). Most of the managers (32.5%) were from Gulf nations. Asians accounted for 28.6% of respondents; Saudis, for 25.4%.
   Survey participants were asked about three main dimensions of individual work performance:
• task performance—the things they do that directly or indirectly contribute to the organization’s technical core,
• adaptive performance—the ability to adjust to changes in environment, circumstances, culture, context, and personnel on the job.
• contextual performance—actions that support the organizational, social, and psychological environment in which the technical core must function, such as helping, following rules, cooperating, and volunteering.
   The task performance questionnaire (adopted from Koopmans et al., 2013, 2014) included the relevant task performance

All the items were measured on a 5-point Likert scale (1 = seldom; 5 = always). The reliability α value was .756.
   For the adaptive performance questionnaire (adopted from Koopmans et al., 2013, 2014), six key adaptive performance dimensions were chosen: showing resiliency (coping with stress, difficult situations, and adversities), coming up with creative solutions to novel difficult problems, keeping job knowledge upto date, keeping job skills upto date, dealing with uncertain and unpredictable work situations, and adjusting work goals when necessary. The dimensions were measured on a 5-point Likert scale (1 = seldom; 5 = always). The reliability α value was .78.
   The contextual performance scale was divided into two subdimensions: interpersonal and organizational (Koopmans et al., 2014). At the interpersonal level, four indicators were selected: taking the initiative, accepting and learning from feedback, cooperating with others, and communicating effectively. Four relevant indicators at the organizational level were also identified: showing responsibility, being customeroriented, being creative, and taking on challenging work tasks. All the items were measured on a 5-point Likert scale (1 = seldom; 5 = always). The reliability α value was .723.
   Job satisfaction was taken as a predictor variable that measured individual performance indicators. The 20-factor Minnesota Satisfaction Questionnaire was adapted to measure job satisfaction. One of the outputs from the Work Adjustment Project at the University of Minnesota, this questionnaire is based on the assumption that work fit is dependent on the relationship between individual skills and reinforcements in the work environment (Weiss, Dawis, England, & Lofquist, 1967). The Minnesota Satisfaction Questionnaire items were rated on a 5-point Likert scale:1 = "very dissatisfied with this aspect of my job,” 2 = "dissatisfied with this aspect of my job,” 3 = "cannot decide if I am satisfied or dissatisfied with this aspect of my job,” 4 = "satisfied with this aspect of my job,” and 5 = "very satisfied with this aspect of my job.” The reliability α value was .85.
  Resilience was taken as a mediating variable to evaluate its impact on job satisfaction and individual performance indicators. The 25-item ResilienceScale (RS) was taken from Wagnild and Young (1993). The respondents were asked to indicate the degree to which they agreed (or disagreed) with each item on a seven-point Likert scale (1 = strongly disagree; 7 = strongly agree). The RS-14, a shortened version of the RS, consists of 14 items selected from the original RS (Losoi et al., 2013). This version included these items: “I am able to manage myself more than anyone else,” “I usually take things in stride,” “My belief in myself gets me through hard times,” and “In an emergency, I am someone people generally can rely on.” The reliability α value was .823.The same set of variables was used in the regression analysis. The data were screened for missing cases and multicollinearity. Although there were moderate associations between some variables, multicollinearity was found to be inconsequential.
3.1 | 	Statistical results support previous research
The means, standard deviations, and correlations for all the variables in this study are shown in Exhibit 3. Resilience was found to have a significant positive correlation with job satisfaction (.656**), adaptive performance (.402**), contextual performance (.610**), and task performance (.639**). Moreover, job satisfaction was found to have a significant positive correlation with adaptive performance (.272**), contextual performance (.446**), and task performance (.883**). Finally, adaptive performance was found to have a significant positive correlation with contextual performance (.604**) and task performance (.281**), whereas contextual performance was shown to have a significant correlation with task performance (.509**).
   To analyze the mediation effect of resilience, the researchers used Baron and Kenny’s (1986) four-step method with linear multiple regression. The statistical significance of the mediation path was further examined using an SPSS macro developed by Preacher and Hayes (2008).

Thus, the relationship between task performance and job satisfaction was very 
strong. In the second step, resilience was entered. As Exhibit 4 shows, resilience (with a β value of .052) did not have an impact on the relationship between task performance and job satisfaction (β value = .831**). Thus, the hypothesis that resilience mediates the relationship between job satisfaction and task performance was rejected.
   The mediating effect of resilience on the relationship between job satisfaction and contextual performance also was measured. The findings revealed that the relationship between job satisfaction and contextual performance was significant (β value of .390**). In addition, the analysis showed that resilience (with β value of .741, p < .001) completely mediated the relationship between contextual performance and job satisfaction. Therefore, the hypothesis that resilience mediates the relationship between job satisfaction and contextual performance was accepted.
   The mediating effect of resilience on job satisfaction and adaptive performance was analyzed through linear multiple regression analysis. The relationship between job satisfaction and adaptive performance was found to be significant (β value of .314**). As shown in Exhibit 4, resilience leadership (with a β value of .598, p < .001) mediates the relationship of adaptive performance and job satisfaction. Therefore, the hypothesis that resilience leadership mediates the relationship between job satisfaction and adaptive performance was confirmed.
   Finally, the mediation effect of resilience on the relationships between job satisfaction with adaptive performance, contextual performance, and task performance was tested using Preacher and Hayes (2008) indirect effect SPSS macro. The numbers of bootstrap samples for bias-corrected bootstrap confidence interval were taken as 10,000 and data were analyzed at confidence intervals of 95% (see Exhibit 5).
EXHIBIT 4 	Linear multiple regression
   The indirect effect of resilience on adaptive performance, contextual performance, and task performance was also analyzed. The results confirmed that resilience mediates the relationship between job satisfaction and adaptive performance and between job satisfaction and contextual performance, and that resilience does not mediate the relationship between job satisfaction and task performance.
4 | STUDY RESULTS: THE IMPACT OF RESILIENCE
The findings of this study of the impact of resilience on the relationship between job satisfaction and individual work performance perspectives show that even though resilience fully mediated adaptive and contextual performance, it did not affect task performance. Adaptive performance, contextual performance, and job satisfaction were shown to have a significant relationship, but when resilience was factored in, the relationship among them became nonsignificant. This finding implies that resilience plays a vital role in job satisfaction, which makes individual adaptive and contextual performance insignificant in affecting job satisfaction. These findings support previous research that highlighted how resilient individuals have the practical acumen to understand certain contexts and situations in which they can influence others while maintaining a strong vision of the future (Caverley, 2005; Coutu, 2002; Everall, Altrows, & Paulson, 2006) and that the more resilient workers are, the higher their level of job satisfaction (Lee & Cha, 2015).

ULCI = upper level confidence interval.   Organizational research has indicated a positive correlation between employee resilience and performance, thus highlighting the importance of developing resilience in the 
workforce. Although the research specifically examining the application of resilience to the workplace has been limited, preliminary studies have returned some positive results. A study of Chinese workers found that resilience was positively related to performance (Luthans, Avolio, Walumbwa, & Li, 2005). While supporting the finding of a positive relationship between resilience and organizational outcomes, a subsequent study suggested that resilience is related to increased organizational profitability, gains in job satisfaction, and increases in commitment to the organization (Luthans, Youssef, & Avolio, 2007). These findings are reinforced in the results of the present study.
Adaptive performance, contextual performance, and job satisfaction were shown to have a significant relationship, but when resilience was factored in, the relationship among them became nonsignificant.
   An investigation of the relationship between collective positive emotions at work and team resilience found that team resilience mediated the relationship between collective positive emotions and team performance. It also concluded that individual job satisfaction fully mediates the relationship between collective perceptions of social context and individual job performance and the relationship between individual work resilience and individual job performance (Meneghel, Salanova, & Martinez, 2016). Kumari & Sangwan (2015) had also shown that there was a positive correlation between resilience capacity and job performance, and previous research had also demonstrated that resilience reduced the negative impact of perceived job insecurity on organizational commitment and job satisfaction (Rus & Baban, 2013). The present study demonstrates resilience as a significant mediator as well.
4.1 | 	Study limitations point to the need  for additional research
Although the objective of this cross-sectional study was to comprehensively assess all the individual work performance dimensions of resilience and job satisfaction, some variables may have been missed. Longitudinal studies should be conducted to address any gaps.
  Future studies can include other job attitudes and contexts and examine them through various mediation and moderation models. The sample size in the present study was a constraint, for it consisted entirely of male managers in a single region. In addition, the study’s reliance on self-reported feedback from the respondents raises the possibility of bias. Future studies should aim to collect data from both genders in a variety of positions and in other industries.
An investigation of the relationship between collective positive emotions at work and team resilience found that team resilience mediated the relationship between collective positive emotions and team performance.
5 | 	IMPLICATIONS FOR MANAGERS
Ultimately, managers are responsible for creating a work environment that fosters resilience. Excessive pressure on employees can lead to burnout, which will eventually have detrimental effects on the overall organization (Hiebert, 2006). It is up to managers to ensure that workloads are reasonable and facilitate effective performance.
Cultivating a sense of community and cohesion also will help establish positive work associations that can increase job satisfaction and resiliency among employees, particularly those working in stressful environments.
   The research presented here can provide some direction for practitioners in helping to engender resilience among workers, so they will be better equipped to handle the challenges they encounter. A proactive initiative to create a culture of trust, responsibility, increased performance, and satisfaction can do much to enhance resiliency. Policies and practices that address the successful management of stress can help ensure that employees’ emotions are directed to job performance and efficiency.
   A framework for developing resiliency requires the genuine understanding and commitment of top management. Therefore, efforts should be made to develop resilient leaders through regular leadership programs at the junior levels. This would help ensure a virtuous cycle of resilient leaders culled from a resilient labor pool. Cultivating a sense of community and cohesion also will help establish positive work associations that can increase job satisfaction and resiliency among employees, particularly those working in stressful environments.
   The implications of resiliency are essential to organizational leaders across the globe. The task of determining which external variables and which aspects of organizational support and commitment contribute to building resilient employees can no longer be overlooked.
