Construction Management and Economics (July 2003) 21, 523–533An empirical study of the benefits of construction partnering in Hong KongALBERT P. C. CHAN, DANIEL W. M. CHAN and KATHY S. K. HO*Department of Building and Real Estate, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hung Hom, Kowloon, Hong Kong, ChinaReceived 10 June 2002; accepted 7 November 2002Many construction companies have adopted partnering in their construction projects over the past 10–15 years due to favourable project outcomes achieved. Its use in construction projects has been increasing rapidly as its benefits become more apparent and pervasive. This paper reviews the partnering literature within the construction field and tries to portray the comprehensive picture of benefits for the partnering practice. Through partnering and the active involvement of all key project parties, the project is more likely to be completed within budget, on time, and with the least number of conflicts, claims and work defects. Also, this paper reports upon the findings of a questionnaire survey of partnering benefits in Hong Kong. Seventy-eight project participants completed a questionnaire to indicate the relative importance of partnering benefits. The perceived benefits were measured and ranked from the perspectives of the client, contractor and consultant for cross-comparison. The results revealed that ‘Improved relationship amongst project participants’, ‘Improved communication amongst project participants’ and ‘More responsive to the short-term emergency, changing project or business needs’ were the most significant benefits derived from the use of partnering. More partnering arrangements should be actively introduced into the construction procurement process so that every party can enjoy the full benefits of partnering.Keywords: Partnering, benefits, construction projects, Hong KongIntroductionThe construction industry in Hong Kong is a very competitive, high-risk business. It is faced with many problems, such as little co-operation, limited trust, and ineffective communication resulting in an adversarial relationship among all project stakeholders. This kind of relationship is reflected in project delays, difficulty in resolving claims, cost overruns, litigation, and a win–lose climate (Moore et al., 1992). The need for a new procurement approach is therefore all the more urgent and compounded by the experiences of many within the industry, who in the past have suffered as a consequence of litigation or arbitration  proceedings whilst attempting to overcome difficulties (Chan et al., 2002).  Many new management techniques have gained popularity to help solve these hurdles (Schriener, 1991; Eckert, 1994; Sanders, 1994). Partnering is one such technique, which attempts to create an effective project management process between two or more organizations. It aims at generating an organizational environment of trust, open communication and employee involvement (Sanders & Moore, 1992). This is achieved through the rapid creation of a project culture, to fulfil the function, which is served by a corporate culture in longer lasting organizations (Chan et al., 2002b).  Although the benefits of partnering are numerous, the successful implementation of a partnering process is hard work. Changing old habits and building trust do not magically happen (Cowan et al., 1992). People have to make it work and the sceptics will be plentiful at the beginning.*Author for correspondence.

project parties (client, consultant, contractor, subcontractors, construction managers and suppliers), the project is more likely to be completed within budget, on time, and with the least number of conflicts, claims and work defects (Cook and Hancher, 1990; CII, 1991; Cowan et al., 1992; Li et al., 2001). With its emphasis on commitment, trust, equity, teamwork, continual project evaluations, minimized risks, and its mandate for open communication, partnering can help solve problems, and save time and money. The US Army Corps of Engineers and UK oil industry have adopted partnering on both large and small construction contracts since the 1980s. The objectives of this paper are to review the benefits of partnering in general, and report on the findings of a questionnaire survey on the potential benefits associated with partnering in Hong Kong in  particular. Seventy-eight project participants representing different construction projects and organizations completed the questionnaires. The perceived benefits of partnering by the clients, contractors and consultants were measured and compared. Partnering principles should be adopted to the fullest possible extent in future projects for improved project performance.What is partnering?To understand the benefits of partnering, the meaning of partnering should be introduced first. Partnering is the simple process of establishing good working relations between project parties. This helps avoid problems with the project that, in recent times, more often than not leads to litigation (Moore et al., 1992). Partnering is designed to minimize job costs and schedule overruns. Its premise is simple: all contracts build upon the implied covenant of good faith. The partnering process attempts to establish the working relationships between the parties through a mutually developed, formal strategy of commitment and communication aiming towards a ‘win–win’ outcome for all parties (CII, 1991, 1996).Benefits of partneringPartnering benefits all parties, including the owner, the general contractor, subcontractors, management, and on-site employees (Dozzi et al., 1996; Larson and Drexler, 1997). The fundamental principles of partnering – commitment, trust, respect, communication, and equality – are designed to include proper consideration of the interests of all parties at every level (CII, 1991; Cowan et al., 1992). The partnering process empowers all the project personnel accept responsibility and their jobs by delegating decision-making and problem-solving to the lowest possible level of authority (Dunston and Reed, 2000).It is an opportunity to improve the open competitive bid process through the closer personal contacts that partnering requires to function.  Review of the literature indicates that common benefits of partnering can be grouped under thirteen headings: reduced litigation, better cost control, better time control, better quality product, efficient problem solving, closer relationship, enhanced communication, continuous improvement, potential for innovation, lower administrative cost, better safety performance, increased satisfaction and improved culture. Table 1 shows the  matrix of the identified benefits and the frequency of their citation.Reduced litigationLitigation is a major problem in most construction projects. It does not help realize potential saving. In partnering arrangement, the problems of disputes, claims or litigations are greatly reduced through open communication and improved working relationship (Cook and Hancher, 1990; CII, 1991, 1996; Abudayyeh, 1994). Gransberg et al. (1999) advocated that dispute and claim cost on partnering projects was relatively low. Similar conclusions can be found in the research of Li et al. (2001) and Ruff et al. (1996). Bayliss (2002) reported that not a single dispute had escalated to litigation in these partnering projects. This was in stark contrast to the number of disputes received on non-partnered contracts of similar scale (Bloom, 1997).Better cost controlPartnering has a great potential to improve cost performance (Albanese, 1994; Gransberg et al., 1999). Partnering reduces the risk of budget overruns because of improved cost control (Cowan et al., 1992; Moore et al., 1992; Abudayyeh, 1994; Bates, 1994; Brown, 1994; CII, 1996; Hellard, 1996; Ruff et al., 1996; Back & Sanders, 1996; Li et al., 2001). The reasons for better cost performance are many, such as: alleviating rework, reducing scheduled time, heightening involvement of team members, improving trust, reducing scope definition problems, opening communication, lowering change order rates, improving problem solving, eliminating blame shifting, improving understanding of project objectives and decreasing adversarial relations (Albanese, 1994).Better time controlPartnering can reduce delay as a result of better schedule performance (Cowan et al., 1992; Moore et al., 1992; CII, 1996; Ruff et al., 1996; Thompson and Sanders, 1998; Black et al., 2000), timely decisions (Albanese,1994; Li et al., 2001) and reliable programming (Hellard, 1996; Matthews et al., 1996).

Gransberg et al. (1999) also found that fewer number of liquidated lamages were imposed on the partnered projects than the non-partnered ones.Better quality productPartnering produces high quality construction and service and reduces engineering rework (CII, 1991; Moore et al., 1992; Bates, 1994; CII, 1996; Hellard, 1996; Matthews et al., 1996; Thompson and Sanders, 1998; Black et al., 2000; Li et al., 2001). An effective partnering agreement improves project quality by replacing the potentially adversarial traditional relationship and case building with an atmosphere that fosters a team approach to achieve a set of common goals (Cook and Hancher, 1990; Brown, 1994). Albanese (1994) further explained that the partnering process facilitates communication of quality issues, enables earlier recognition of potential problems, and helps develop a quality consciousness. Many of the firms in Albanese’s study were those who are practising total quality management, a management  approach that usually involves the use of partnering.Efficient problem solvingPartnering provides a way to develop a control and resolution mechanism for dealing with problems (Cowan et al., 1992). The partners anticipate potential problems and devise an action plan addressing how those problems are jointly identified and resolved. The partnering agreement allows each party the opportunity of learning and using the other’s problem-solving methods (Cook and Hancher, 1990; Bates, 1994; Hellard, 1996; Conley and Gregory, 1999). Sanders and Moore (1992) concluded that partnering helps eliminate many personal conflicts.Closer relationshipThe close working relationship between the owner, constructor, and engineer provided a better environment of project (Cook and Hancher, 1990; Bayliss, 2000; Drexler and Larson, 2000). Enhanced communication, the identification of shared goals and objectives, the recognition that problems arose, and the agreement to address those problems through a special design procedure facilitated a harmonious relationship (CII, 1991; Harback et al., 1994; Matthews et al., 1996).Non-adversarial attitudeThe traditional adversarial relationship between owner and contractor is stressful and inefficient (Cowan et al., 1992). Partnering aims to reduce adversarial relationship that will allow focus on mutual goals to the benefit of both parties (CII, 1991; Albanese, 1994; CII, 1996; Nielsen, 1996; Conley and Gregory, 1999; Gransberg et al., 1999; Black et al., 2000). The transforming adversarial relationship is the actual change mechanism that transfers usual business into a trust based relationship (Lazar, 1997; Drexler and Larson, 2000).High level of mutual trustPartnering recognizes an implied covenant of good-faith dealing by all parties involved (Harback et al., 1994; Lazar, 1997; Green, 1999). Within this atmosphere of cooperation and mutual trust, the parties can jointly determine and evaluate approaches to design, engineer, and construct the project and result in improving cost and schedule performance (Cook and Hancher, 1990; CII, 1991).Sharing risk and resourcesPartnering enables parties to share the benefits and resources collectively and develop management and technical advances jointly (Cook and Hancher, 1990; Cowan et al., 1992; Li et al., 2001). It also establishes the tools for both measurement and sharing of gains and risks (Ellison and Miller, 1995; Li et al., 2001).Greater responsiveness to problemsPartnering helps actualize the delegation of authority or empowerment to the project personnel. The flexibility and responsiveness of the owner increase under the partnering agreement (Cook and Hancher, 1990). It ensures problem solving at the lowest possible level of authority. A partner can be more responsive to short-term emergency, changing project or business needs (CII, 1991; Green, 1999)Enhanced communicationTo break the traditional hierarchical communication channels, partnering promotes openness, trust and efficient communication through common and alleviative language (CII, 1991; Sanders and Moore, 1992; Li et al., 2001). Increased communication on various subjects means that the parties are less likely to be surprised by schedule delays and additional costs, which often lead to disputes and litigation (Sanders & Moore, 1992; Brown, 1994; Li et al., 2001).Continuous improvementThe traditional responsibility for improvement primarily rests with the contractor who is assumed as a burden maker, while the client and consultants act as a sceptical judge (Cowan et al., 1992). Partnering provides a way for all parties to develop continuous improvement. It is a joint effort and with a long-term focus on eliminating for wasteful barriers to improvement (CII, 1991; Ellison and Miller, 1995; Green, 1999; Black et al., 2000).Potential for innovationAn effective partnering relationship encourages partners to evaluate advanced technology for its applicability (Cook and Hancher, 1990; Hellard, 1996). Proper use of innovation through open communication improves design and construction processes (Abudayyeh, 1994; Bourn, 2001).Lower administrative costPartnering provides a way to lower administrative cost by eliminating defensive case building (Abudayyeh, 1994; CII, 1996; Hellard, 1996; Black et al., 2000). Moreover, the cost to negotiate and administer contracts is decreased as partners become knowledgeable of the counterpart’s legal and litigation concerns (CII, 1991). Hellard (1996) and Cowan et al. (1992) suggested other interesting benefits that partnering reduces paperwork and simplifies administrative procedure. Bayliss (2000) advocated that less paperwork and more face-to-face discussions were made possible in partnered projects.Better safety performanceTaking joint responsibility to ensure a safe working environment for all parties reduces the risk of hazardous working conditions and avoids workplace accidents. Actually, the safety performance can be improved as partners better understand each other and as the knowledge of construction process and systems improves drastically (CII, 1991; Moore et al., 1992; Albanese, 1994; Bates, 1994).Increased satisfactionPartnering provides a more conducive environment of achieving project objectives (Matthews et al., 1996). All parties involved benefit from the partnering agreement. Partnering enhances customer satisfaction as the customer is closer to the construction process and better informed (Nielsen, 1996). Contractors obtain a reasonable profit and are assured of continued work at predetermined profit margins (Moore et al., 1992; Back and Sanders, 1996). Joint satisfaction of all shareholders is possible (Cowan et al., 1992). The work becomes enjoyable rather than a burden or an unreasonable risk (Bates, 1994). The project team – the contractors, suppliers, and designers – have higher levels of satisfaction and necessary actions are taken much sooner based on their active input (Nielsen, 1996).Improved cultureBloom (1997) indicated that evaluations of Army partnering contracts had shown a distinct improvement in the culture of the people working on the contract. When people work in a conflict-free environment, they concentrate on the job rather than on potential claims, and the morale and effectiveness of the whole ‘team’ is improved (Brown, 1994; Ruff et al., 1996; Bloom, 1997).Survey methodologyAn empirical study was undertaken in Hong Kong in early 2001 to investigate the benefits of partnering. The 13 common partnering benefits identified in the literature were re-phrased and expanded into 24 statements, which formed the basis of an empirical questionnaire (Table 2). An industry-wide survey was conducted to explore the perceptions of benefits towards partnering by different project stakeholders. Respondents were requested to rate their degree of agreement against each of the identified benefits according to a five-point Likert scale (1 = Strongly Disagree and 5 = Strongly Agree) with reference to a particular partnering project they had been involved in.  In this research study, senior staff of the organizations, which were observed from local trade magazines, newspapers, Internet information and relevant sources, were contacted and some key project participants of partnering projects were identified. Also, with the support of  the Hong Kong Housing Authority (HKHA) and the Association for Project Management, Hong Kong (APMHK), 355 questionnaires were delivered to the potential respondents. Due to the limitation of time, the respondents were given only two weeks to complete and return the questionnaires. Table 3 shows the detailed breakdown of the received questionnaires. Finally, the response rate of this survey was 30.4%. Seventy-eight questionnaires were returned and used for analysis.  The 78 returned questionnaires included client’s organizations (18 respondents), main contractors (37  respondents), consultants (17 respondents), and subcontractor firms (three respondents). Three respondents could not be identified in terms of the type of organization (Figure 1).Method of data analysisChan and Kumaraswamy (1996a) adopted the ‘mean score’ method to establish the relative importance of reasons for delay in civil engineering projects in Hong Kong, as suggested by the clients, consultants and contractors. The data collected from the current questionnaire survey was analysed using the same technique, within various groups as categorized according to the role of the parties involved in the Hong Kong building construction (whether clients, consultants or contractors). The fivepoint Likert scale (1 being strongly disagree and 5 being strongly agree) described previously was used to calculate the mean score for each benefit, which was then used to determine the relative ranking of different benefits by comparing the individual mean score for each benefits in descending order of importance. These rankings made it possible to cross-compare the relative importance of the benefits as postulated by the three various groups of respondents. The mean score (MS) for each benefit was computed by the following formula:MS =∑(Nf s× ) , (1≤ MS ≤ 5)                   (1)where s = score given to each benefit by the respondents and ranges from 1 to 5, where 1 is ‘strongly disagree’ and 5 is ‘strongly agree’;f = frequency of response to each rating (1–5), for each benefit;N = total number of response concerning that benefit.  Based on the nature of project participants, they were divided into three groups for analysis: the client’s group, contractor’s group and consultant’s group.

The agreement of respondents within a group on their Kendall’s coefficient of concordance (W) for the benefits rankings of benefits. If the Kendall’s coefficient of was computed by the following formula (Siegel and concordance (W) was significant at the level of 0.05, a Castellan, 1988):
Figure 1	Organization types for respondents n	2 ∑(R Ri − )W = i=1 2	(2) n n( −1 12)/                                                          where n = number of benefits being rankedRi= average of the ranks assigned to the ith benefit;R= the average of the ranks assigned across all  benefits.  The agreement between two respondent groups on their rankings of benefits of partnering projects was measured by the Spearman rank correlation coefficient (rs).  Again, if rs was significant at the 0.05 level, an association between the two sets of rankings was established. The Spearman rank correlation coefficient (rs) for the benefits was computed by the following formula (SPSS, 2002):6∑d2	rs = −1	2 −1)	(3)N N(where d = the difference in rank of two parties;N = total number of response concerning that benefit.These analysis procedures had been used by other similar survey studies such as Chan (1998), Mezher & Tawil (1998), and Chan (2000).Analysis of survey resultsThe perceived benefits of partnering projects were assessed from different perspectives of the client’s group, contractor’s group and consultant’s group. The rankings by each respondent were transformed into a matrix as the imported data from the calculation of the Kendall’s coefficient of concordance using the SPSS package (SPSS, 2001). The results of computation of the Kendall’s coefficient of concordance and the rankings are presented in Table 4.  Kendall’s coefficient of concordance (W) for the rankings of benefits among all respondents was 0.134; among the client’s group, 0.157; among the contractor’s group, 0.163; and among the consultant’s group, 0.231. The computed Ws were all significant at 0.000 (Table 4). The null hypothesis that the respondents’ ratings within a certain group are unrelated to each other had to be rejected. Thus it can be concluded that there is significant amount of agreement among the respondents in each group and all respondents on the rankings of the benefits of their partnering projects.  The next stage of the analysis was to test whether there is any similar substantial agreement among the respondents in the three groups which is determined by the Spearman rank correlation coefficient (rs) using the SPSS package (SPSS, 2001). The correlation coefficients of the ranking on benefits were 0.662, 0.707, and 0.802 for client and contractor, client and consultant, and contractor and consultant, respectively (Table 5). The null  hypothesis that there is no significant disagreement between clients–contractors, clients–consultants, and contractors–consultants on the ranking of benefits for the partnering projects has to be accepted (Tables 5 and 6). Therefore, it was concluded with 99% confidence that there was a significant agreement on the ranking of benefits among clients, consultants and contractors.Discussion of survey resultsIt should be stressed that the ranking exercise is based on perception, not an objective assessment. A subjective assessment of the ranking result is made to the analysis of the perceived relative importance of factors. The fact that this subjective assessment does not provide any absolutevalue on the ranking position is recognized. Emphasis is then given only to factors that are placed as the most important and the least important in the ranking list (Chan & Yeong, 1995; Chan & Kumaraswamy, 1996b).  The analysis of the ranking exercise indicates some interesting results which show a significant agreement among the participants of each group on the ranking of benefits. Table 4 reflects that the rankings of clients, consultants and contractors were not significantly different as deduced from the values of significance level (0.000). All of them believed and ranked the ‘Improvement of relationship and communication amongst project participants’ to be the top two benefits. The results are consistent with the findings reported in the publications of CII (1991), (1996) and CIB (1997). Bayliss (2000) and Drexler and Larson (2000) further explained that partnering provides a better working environment for and enhances the relationship among all contracting parties. It also creates an efficient hierarchy of communication channels to the clients, consultants and contractors

Figure 2	Cross-comparison of benefits among respondentsbe more conscious about project time performance. Chan and Kumaraswamy (2002) explained that a project is regarded as successful if it is completed on time, within budget and to the level of quality standard specified by the client. The difference between the clients and consultants/ contractors may indicate that the clients draw closer attention to the performance outcome especially on time. Thus, clients try to use partnering to secure a better project time performance for economic reasons such as the attractive capital returns anticipated from the finished buildings.  Similar results were also found in item 8 ‘Achievement in better design quality’ which was ranked 10th by clients, but out of the top 10 benefits by both consultants and contractors. Chan and Kumaraswamy (2002) asserted the achievement of the level of quality standards specified by the clients to be one of the criteria for project success. Clients also believe that partnering could improve the design quality.  While clients ranked item 1 ‘Reduction in litigation’ at 16, consultants ranked it eighth and contractors sixth. The difference may be attributed to their various areas of involvement in project activities. Contractors and consultants usually worked more closely on litigation issues and may find that much litigation can be reduced and eliminated via partnering agreements. Thus, they perceive that partnering could reduce the chance of litigation.  Clients and consultants ranked item 15 ‘Achievement of long term trust relationship’ as the 10th benefit, whereas contractors ranked it third. Similarly, clients and consultants assigned a very high rank (second and fourth, respectively) for item 2 ‘Achievement of better productivity’ whereas contractors assigned a relatively low rank (10th). An analogous result was also found for item 21 ‘Improvement of conflict resolution strategies’. Clients and consultants considered it fifth and eighth, whereas contractors evaluated it out of the top 10 benefits (13th in importance). Perhaps this is reflexive of the real-life situation that the consultants (architects/engineers) usually act as agents of the client in all matters relating to the contract. The consultants represent the client as the project managers, and are responsible for design work and construction supervision of the project on site. Hence, they should establish a convergence of perceptions on the benefits (Chan and Kumaraswamy, 1996b). However, the contractors held different viewpoints on the ranking of this benefit. This disagreement may explain the different expectations and interpretation of partnering arrangement between consultants and contractors as to, for example, who is responsible for project delays and cost overruns. In an investigation of the reasons for project delays, Chan and Kumaraswamy (1996a) pointed out that the differences in the viewpoints between groups on the ranking exercise might be due to some ‘group bias’ in their perceptions, despite the considerably high and similar experience level of the survey respondents.  The result shown in Table 5 demonstrated that there was a substantial agreement on the rankings of partnering benefits between groups of respondents. One more noteworthy point is that the profiles for each of the 24 listed benefits of partnering indicate, in general, a close scatter pattern as shown in Figure 2. The closely scattered pattern may manifest that most project participants in Hong Kong exhibited a positive attitude towards partnering which could bring several perceived benefits to their projects. For example, Bayliss (2000) asserted that the Mass Transit Railway Corporation (MTRC) is willing to promote the use of partnering, as they intend to achieve excellence in construction through implementing partnering concept in their projects.ConclusionsA questionnaire survey was conducted in order to find out the major benefits of partnering in the Hong Kong construction industry as perceived by clients, consultants and contractors. All parties generally agreed on the ranking of benefits. According to the clients, the most important benefit was ‘Faster construction time’, while both contractors and consultants ranked ‘Improvement of relationship amongst project participants’ as the most significant benefit. All three groups agreed that ‘Improvement in communication amongst project participants’ was one of the most important benefits. The findings are in line with the conclusions drawn in CII (1991), CII (1996), CIB (1997), and Bennett and Jayes (1998). Sanders and Moore (1992)  and Li et al. (2001) further explained that team-building and problem-solving techniques are the essential elements of partnering success. The results also demonstrated that the position and role of project participants may influence their perceptions of partnering benefits. A benefit to one group may be a burden to the others.  Partnering has evolved as an innovative approach to the procurement method in the Hong Kong construction industry over the years. Many organizations including clients and contractors are striving to gain real-life experience on partnering practice in solving potential problems facing the construction industry today. As always, those organizations which are more far sighted and gear themselves to operate efficiently in this new environment will reap rewards derived to the latecomers (Chan et al., 2002a). Clients and contractors are more supportive of the partnering concept and should take the lead in promoting partnering.  The research study had identified the benefits of implementing the innovative procurement method – partnering. Although the results only reported some local findings, they are also useful to other countries for international comparison. A parallel study on the problems associated with partnering had been completed for comparison. After identifying the perceived benefits and potential problems of partnering in construction, a further investigation of the critical success factors (CSFs) for partnering projects can be launched to formulate effective strategies for implementation (Chan et al., 2002a). Partnering is at a germinating stage of development in Hong Kong and the pace of introducing its concepts and applications in construction is gaining drastic momentum. As a major recommendation in the report by the local Construction Industry Review Committee (CIRC), the wider adoption of a partnering arrangement should be encouraged in the future so as to foster an efficient, innovative and productive construction industry (CIRC, 2001).AcknowledgementsThe authors gratefully acknowledge The Hong Kong Polytechnic University for providing funding to support this research study.
