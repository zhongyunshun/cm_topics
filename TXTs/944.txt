Granger causality methodology is used to investigate lead± lag relationships between construction activity and aggregate economy. Using data from Hong Kong, the results of this paper suggest strongly that the GDP tends to lead the construction ¯ ow not vice versa. Our ® nding is contrary to the view that construction is more volatile than the GDP. However, our results show that the construction volatility after 1990 is smaller than that in the period 1983± 1989, a result that is particularly important for policymakers in that it is the macroeconomic policy of government that affects output, and in¯ uences the construction activity, and not

vice versa.

Introduction
At ® rst sight, construction output is an integral part of national output. It is possible that expansion of construction activity is preceded by an increase in economic output, with the initial effect felt largely within the construction sector and only subsequently on the aggregate economy. Akintoye and Skitmore (1994) suggest that construction investment is a derived demand which is growth dependent. However, the results of the econometric models used by Akintoye and Skitmore (1994), who tested the relationship between national output and construction demand, are mixed. If markets are interdependent, disturbances in one market will be transmitted to other markets. However, there have been few empirical studies of relationships between the construction sector and the aggregate economy. The issue of concern here is whether the construction sector and the aggregate economy are segmented or interdependent, and whether construction activity contributes to economic growth and/or vice versa. The purpose of the present paper is to examine the speci® c lead± lag relationships
0144± 6193  1997 E & FN Spon
between construction ¯ ow and gross domestic product (GDP). Granger causality methodology is commonly applied to investigations on the relationships among money supply, stock prices and in¯ ation, but no-one has tested the linkages between the construction sector and the aggregate economy using this method. In addition, we will make use of the most recent innovations in the literature of unit root tests.
  The following section presents the results of the unit root analysis to study the stationarity of GDP and construction ¯ ow. Accordingly, we employ Granger causality methodology to investigate the lead± lag relationships between the construction ¯ ow and the GDP. We will also examine whether volatilities in the construction sector are excessive relative to the volatilities in the output.
Unit root tests
The casual tests of Granger (1969) are essentially tests of the predictive ability of time-series models. However, Granger causality tests require the use of stationary time-series data (Granger and Newbold, 1974; Ong, 1994; Huang, 1995). Under current practice, developing such data requires the observed data series be tested for unit roots. The tests for unit roots are known also as Dickey± Fuller (DF) and augmented Dickey± Fuller (ADF) tests. Typically, the ADF test is based on the following formulation: D Yt 5 m 1 d T 1 a Yt2 1 1 o b i D Yt2 i 1 ut (1)
n i5 1
where D Yt = Yt ± Yti, m is a drift term and T is the time trend with the null hypothesis H0: a = 0 and its alternative hypothesis H1: a ¹ 0, n is the number of lags necessary to obtain white noise and ut is the error term. The simpler Dickey± Fuller (DF) test removes the summation term. However, the implied t statistic is not the Student t distribution, but instead is generated from Monte Carlo simulations (Engle and Granger, 1987, 1991). Note that failing to reject H0 implies the time series is non-stationary.
  In this study, GDP is an expenditure-based estimate, compiled using current market prices. The construction ¯ ow (CTN), measured at current market prices, refers to: new construction works and renovation and maintenance, including the erection of new buildings and structures and installation of service facilities such as utility ® ttings and ventilation systems; major alteration and conversion works on existing structures; demolition, site formation, piling and other sub-structure work preceding the actual erection of structures; and the restoration of existing buildings and structures to normal condition. All of the data come from the Hong Kong Monthly Digest of Statistics (various issues). Since quarterly data of CTN before 1983 are not available, the study employs data from 1983Q1 to 1995Q1. The quarterly data used in this analysis contain the gross value of construction work put in place by main contractors within and outside construction sites. Each round of the survey covers approximately 1850 construction establishments. All main contractors employing over 100 persons at construction sites, and all other
	Table 1	Results of unit root testsa
construction establishments engaging 100 persons or more, are fully enumerated. The others are surveyed using rational replicated sampling (Census and Statistics Department, Hong Kong, Report of the
Quarterly Survey of Construction Output). The value of work put in place is obtained from progress payments received during the reference period, after deducting the value of work done before the reporting period and adding payment received afterwards for work done during the reference period. The procedure adopted is prone to estimating errors. However, the difference between the data compiled for the quarterly estimates and the estimates of construction in the annual GDP ® gures computed from more detailed information has been shown to be only marginal. It is noteworthy that construc-tion ¯ ow data do not include expenditure on investigations, surveys and designs that are incurred before construction work commences. Also it does not include expenses incurred by clients on supervision during construction (Census and Statistics Department, Hong Kong, Estimates on Gross Domestic Product 1966 to 1992, March 1993).

The critical values of DF statistics are: 3.5 with trend and 2.93 without trend, and 4.15 with trend and 3.58 without trend at the 5% and 1% levels of signi® cance, respectively.  Table 1 reports the DF and ADF test statistics on the natural logarithm of the CTN and GDP in regression (1) omitting minus signs for simplicity. In Table 1, the null hypothesis of unit root for GDP, in level form with and without time trend, is rejected at all conventional levels of signi® cance, but not rejected for CTN when the calculated Dickey± Fuller test statistics associated with the numerical coef® cients of GDPt± 1 and CTNt± 1 are compared with its critical values, as given in Engle and Granger (1987). We will assume the CTN series is non-stationary in level terms. The two series were (log) ® rst-differenced and the unit root tests re-run; in this form, the DF and ADF (with one lag) test statistics reject the hypothesis of a unit root at all conventional levels of signi® cance, suggesting that the variables appear to be ® rstdifference stationary (i.e. I(1)). For comparisons, the causality tests were carried out in level form and then in ® rst-differences of the data.
Construction ¯ ows and output
Causality test results
To test whether construction ¯ ow stimulates aggregate economy or aggregate economy leads the construction activity, or if there exist feedback effects between construction ¯ ows and the aggregate economy, the Granger causality test is used in the present study,
® tted with quarterly data from 1983Q1 to 1995Q1. This is represented by (see Granger, 1969; Ashley et al., 1980; Thornton, 1993; Ng, 1995)

CTNt 5	 o a 1i GDPt2	i 1 o b 1i CTNt2	i 1	 vi	(3) n	n
	i5	1	i5	1
where causality implies CTN is Granger-causing GDP provided that some a 0i is not zero in Equation 2. Similarly, GDP is Granger-causing CTN if some a 1i is not zero in Equation 3. If both of these events occur, then feedback effects exist. The basic concept of the Granger causality tests is that future values cannot predict past or present values. If past values of CTN do contribute signi® cantly to the explanation of GDP, then CTN is said to Granger-cause GDP. This means that CTN is Granger-causing GDP when past values of CTN have predictive power of the current value of GDP even if the past values of GDP are taken into consideration. Conversely, if GDP is Granger-causing CTN, it would be expected that GDP change would take place before a change in CTN.
  To implement the Granger causality test, F statistics are calculated under the null hypothesis that in
Equations 2 and 3 all the coef® cients of a 0i , a 1i = 0. Following the unit root tests, stationarity can be induced by the ® rst-differencing of the level data. Since the number of lags in the causality model is arbitrary, the regression is run twice by setting the order of lags = 4 and 5. Table 2 presents the results of the Granger causality tests for the natural logarithm of the variables. From the F statistics, the causal effect running from construction ¯ ows to the GDP in our sample is statistically rejected, in both level form and ® rst-differences of the data. However, the hypothesis of causality from the GDP to the construction ¯ ow is not rejected in both level form and ® rst-differences of the data. Thus, the results suggest strongly that the GDP tends to lead the amount of construction ¯ ow. One could carry out the test for different values of the lags and make sure that conclusions are robust and not model dependent. This would also provide for the longer lags necessary to account for the time lags between the two series. When the Granger-causality tests were re-run with a longer lag (7 quarters), the results remained the same as before.

aNote that * indicates signi® cant at the 5% level. The null hypothesis of no causality is rejected if the F statistics exceed the critical values.
Thus the conclusion that construction ¯ ow is not Granger-causing GDP is robust.
  It should be noted that construction output statistics are based on the value of work billed by construction ® rms after appropriate adjustments for work done outside the period of cash receipts. In Hong Kong, output on a contract will lag construction orders, i.e. arrival of contract, by 3 quarters to 1 year. Construction work in Hong Kong is subject to cyclical periods which last considerably longer than the normal construction activity because Hong Kong undertakes a lot of reclamation work. A minimum period of at least 10 years is likely to be required for completion of the reclamation-based development process. This is due to the time needed to prepare feasibility studies, the gazetting of plans under various ordinances, the provision of new transport infrastructure linking with the land development, the allocation of funds, land acquisition and clearance, and the completion of engineering and building works. It is also plausible that many contractors improve cash¯ ows in the early stages of the work further by pricing early parts of the work arti® cially high, commonly referred to as `frontloading’. Work on a large project is usually parcelled out into a number of individual contracts (Fleming, 1988). While it is not possible to measure the pattern of the receipt of orders over time satisfactorily, it is clear that the ¯ ow of orders will be re¯ ected to some extent in variations in construction outputs.
Volatility of construction work and GDP
The relationship between construction ¯ ow and GDP is analogous to the saving± income relationship, which suggests a curious paradox, sometimes called the
`paradox of thrift’. The national income identity (GNP = saving + consumption) does not imply that an increase in saving will lead to a higher GNP. Generally, it is believed that the initial impact of a change of GDP would be on demand for construction projects and real estate, rather than on the level of construction output. A major reason for the cyclical nature of construction is that construction activity is very sensitive to credit conditions. The Keynesians argue that changes in the level of economic activity tend to cause changes in money supply, which reverses the causality suggested by the monetarists. It follows that money supply causes ¯ uctuations in the construction ¯ ow. A decrease in income causes a fall in credit supply, which in its turn causes a drop in construction activity and employment. On the other hand, an upswing of the economy started by a lower interest rate or an increase in business con® dence will raise demand for construction orders. It follows that more construction work will raise GDP through the multiplier, which in turn leads to a higher demand for construction orders. It should be noted that the demand for construction work is not autonomous. Rather it is determined by the level of GDP. Ball and Wood (1996) show that long run equilibrium levels of national income are associated with equivalent equilibrium levels of particular types of investment. If GDP rises, so will the level of construction activity needed to meet the expanded production capacity. Thus, it is expected that at higher levels of GDP an economy can absorb a higher level of construction activity. However, if the demand for construction work increases, then this, other things being equal, will raise interest rates that businesses must pay to borrow funds to ® nance new investment. There is some evidence that the interaction between credit supply and construction activity aggravates the in¯ ationary pressures within the economy. Construction is an industry whose products are only weakly tradable, and in the short term construction booms tend to push up output prices rather than contribute to GDP growth. In the longer term, however, higher construction ¯ ows are likely to increase the GDP by adding to the nation’s capital stock.
  Construction is an investment-goods industry, and is therefore characterized by a labour market that is highly ¯ exible (Ball and Wood, 1995; Ganesan et al., 1996). Thus, productivity in construction has not increased at the same rate as elsewhere. Ball and Morrison (1995) argue that all types of ® xed investment are considerably more volatile than national income. It is expected that short term growth rates of construction ¯ ows can easily ¯ uctuate a lot due to changes in capacity utilization, even if the rate of capacity growth is quite steady. Groak (1994) argues that construction activities are determined signi® cantly by projects, not by ® rms. Because of the ¯ exibility of the construction industry, the construction activity can be slowed down through the extension of construction durations. In a separate study, Chan and Kumaraswamy (1995) show that construction duration is directly related to its costs. An investment goods industry is, generally, subject to ¯ uctuations in demand resulting from changes in expectations. The greater the volatility of constructions the larger the uncertainty faced by market players. There is a widely held view that very large ¯ uctuations brought about by factors outside the control of government are damaging to the overall ef® ciency of the industry, and that policies should be established to make the construction industry more stable. Thus, the effect of construction on the economy through the production process and through the effects of credit constraint can be as important as the effect of the economy on the construction sector (Hillebrandt, 1985). It is, thus, argued that construction is a sector of dynamic development with a growth rate exceeding that of the aggregate economy (Sugden in Turin, 1975; Sebestyen, 1980).
  The measures of volatilities can be based on the ex post variances of the rates of growth around a trend to avoid statistical biases. Based on F tests, it may be preferable to compare volatility of construction activity with that of GDP, and identify whether there is a signi® cant change of volatility across time periods. Because of the political shock arising from the 4 June 1989 incident, we expect there to have been signi® cant change in the two periods 1983± 1989 and 1990± 1995 (Tse, 1996). First, for each GDP and CTN, we compare the volatilities between the two periods 1983Q1± 1989Q4 versus 1990Q1± 1995Q1. Then, we compare the volatilities of GDP and CTN in the three periods 1983Q1± 1989Q4, 1990Q1± 1995Q1 and 1983Q1± 1995Q1. A series can be used to calculate a set of N continuously compounded growth rates as follows: zi = log(xi /xi ± 1) where xi and xi ± 1 denote GDP or CTN at current market prices at times i and i ± 1, respectively. The next step is to estimate the average growth rate: zm = å zi /N, which represents the slope of the trend line xi. The average growth rate is then used in calculating the per-period variance: s x2 = å (zi ± zm)2/(N ± 1). Note that the value of the perperiod variance depends upon the length of time over which each growth rate is measured. The measure of volatility around a constant trend line is adequate for short periods. Despite the small sample size, the F statistics are adjusted by the degree of freedom. The results are reported in Table 3, and Figure 1 depicts the movement of GDP and CTN over time.
  The results show that the volatility of construction activity in the period of 1983Q1± 1989Q4 is signi® cantly larger than it is in 1990Q1± 1995Q1. Moreover, Table 4 shows that the average trend growth rates of GDP and CTN are signi® cantly different in the period 1983Q1± 1989Q4. Also, while the volatility

of the construction activity is signi® cantly larger than that of GDP in the period 1983Q1± 1989Q4, their volatilities are not signi® cantly different in the whole period 1983Q1± 1995Q1. Furthermore, average trend growth rates of GDP and CTN in the period 1990Q1± 1995Q1 as well as the whole period 1983Q1± 1995Q1 are not signi® cantly different (Table 4). This evidence suggests that construction activity seems to be more stable during 1990s than it was before. In addition, we compare the volatility of construction ¯ ow’s GDP share in the three periods. The volatility is computed using the Kalman ® lter technique, which allows the trend and cyclical components to vary stochastically with time (Harvey, 1989). The results (Table 4) show that the economy has had greater construction ¯ ow/GDP share ¯ uctuations in the period 1990Q1± 1995Q1. Since there were no marked changes of volatility of GDP in these periods, this suggests that GDP volatility is not transmitted as greater disturbances to the construction sector. Rather, the combined effects of economic ¯ uctuations and uncertainty are the likely cause of the construction volatility. It is also interesting to note that the average value of the CTN/GDP share decreases from 9.4% in 1983Q1± 1995Q1 to 9.2% in 1990Q1± 1995Q1. It seems that there is a strong inter-temporal diversion of the series. The reason for the gradual decreasing CTN/GDP share may be due to the effect of a substitution away from buildings and towards equipment

over time (Ball and Wood, 1996). Consequently, the shift towards new methods of construction requires less construction work per unit of GDP.
Conclusion
Using unit root tests and Granger causality tests, we have tested the lead± lag relationship between gross domestic product and construction ¯ ow. Although some propose that a decrease in construction activity causes a fall in income and employment (e.g. Hillebrandt, 1985), we argue that a change of GDP initially will affect demand for construction projects, then housing and credit availability, and then the level of construction output. Construction cycles tend to be associated with periods of easy credit. The results, while ® tting with Hong Kong’s data in the period of 1983Q1± 1995Q1, are consistent with our arguments. We have found that GDP leads construction ¯ ows, and not vice versa, at least in the short term.
  It has been argued that short term growth rates of construction activities tend to exhibit much greater ¯ uctuations than the aggregate economy. However, based on F tests, we show that: (i) the volatility of the construction ¯ ows in the period of 1983Q1± 1989Q4 is signi® cantly larger than it is in 1990Q1± 1995Q1, (ii) the volatility of the construction ¯ ows is signi® cantly larger than that of GDP in the period of 1983Q1± 1989Q4, and (iii) the difference between the volatilities of GDP and of construction ¯ ows is not signi® cantly different from zero in the whole period 1983Q1± 1995Q1. However, there is evidence of an inter-temporal diversion of the GDP and the construction ¯ ow. We show that the average value of the CTN/GDP share was higher in 1983Q1± 1995Q1 than the period of 1990Q1± 1995Q1.
  The result of this paper is particularly important for policymakers in that, in the short term, it is the macroeconomic policy of government which affects output, and in¯ uences the construction activity. Our ® nding is also contrary to the view that construction is more volatile than the aggregate economy. Although Hong Kong is a very special case, we suggest there is a need for the development of new economic analysis to assist in the understanding of the construction process.
