Construction Management and Economics (2002) 20, 3–12The evidence of complex variability in construction labour productivityMILAN RADOSAVLJEVIC´* and R. MALCOLM W. HORNERConstruction Management Research Unit, Department of Civil Engineering, University of Dundee, Dundee DD1 4HN, UKReceived 19 June 2000; accepted 24 September 2001The complex variability of the 12 construction labour productivity data sets has been examined by analysing the central moments of tendency, and applying the Kolmogorov–Smirnov and Anderson–Darling tests of normality. The results consistently show that the productivity is not normally distributed. In addition, unde ned variance causes a failure of the central limit theorem, thus indicating that some basic statistical diagnostics like correlation coef cients and t statistics may give misleading results and are not applicable. A brief comparison with volatility studies in econometrics has revealed surprising similarity with Pareto distributions, which can model unde ned or in nite variance. Such distributions are typical of chaotic systems like the logistic equation, whose properties also are described brie y. Therefore, it is suggested that future research should be focused on studying the applicability of chaos theory to construction labour. Keywords: Construction, labour productivity, normal distribution, tests, chaosIntroductionVariability has been shown to be a key factor in our study of the behaviour of construction labour productivity (Noor, 1992; Lema and Price, 1996). Construction projects are often turbulent because of the number of variables involved, the labour intensive work, the unique character, and the occurrence of unpredictable events (Choromokos and McKee, 1981; Arditi, 1985; Thomas and Yiakoumis, 1987; Thomas et al., 1990; Horner and Talhouni, 1995; Kaming et al., 1996). These factors are major causes of stagnation in the industry in terms of low pro tability and productivity. Manufacturing has increased its productivity by more than 100% in the past 30 years whereas construction is in decline (Choromokos and McKee, 1981; Briscoe, 1988). It is no wonder, then, that most of the researchon productivity issues has been concerned mainly with aspects that should lead to improvements (Tavakoli, 1985; Thomas and Yiakoumis, 1987; Proverbs et al., 1999), like poor on-site management (Choromokos and McKee, 1981; Oglesby et al., 1989) and the impact of delays and interruptions (Horner and Talhouni, 1995). Labour intensive work, unique design, the number of factors affecting on-site work and other variables make the construction industry unstable in its performance. These variables create many undesirable events that threaten planned budgets and cause major delays. Thus, often the budget is exceeded in order to meet the client’s requirements and complete a project within speci ed period. Hence, a high net pro t margin seems to be the exception rather than the rule. Consequently, improving labour productivity should be a major concern for research and for the industry.

improvement. Appropriate descriptions of complex variability can reveal information to enhance our understanding of the underlying processes.ObjectivesThis study demonstrates that construction labour productivity involves dynamic interactions within a complex system of variables. Therefore, the basic assumption is non-normality, which is common to many natural processes (Peters, 1991; Gleick, 1993; Kaye, 1993; Lorenz, 1995). Several reports have shown that economic  uctuations, which are similar to  uctuations in productivity, correspond to some internal nonperiodic cyclical order that is not random behaviour (Peters, 1991; Papaioannou and Karytinos, 1995). If non-normality is one of the properties of productivity, then our knowledge and understanding of the processes that generate such behaviour are inadequate. The objective is to reveal evidence that normality (random behaviour) is not a characteristic of productivity. Some recent studies of economic  uctuations show similar non-normal behaviour, and suggest that these may follow the laws of chaos theory. This is also the main reason for suggesting the application of chaos theory in future research on productivity.  The present study is based upon applied statistical techniques. It starts from the core knowledge of some basic statistical properties in order to reveal evidence that classical statistics cannot fully describe productivity. This is further shown to be the major obstacle to achieving a clear understanding of the construction industry’s performance and its internal project-related dynamism, which can lead to enormous  uctuations in productivity.Methodology and dataFive formwork and seven masonry data sets from 11 different sites in the USA and the UK were analysed. Originally they were in the following form.	Total man hours in day i	h	Pi = ————————————Unit output in day i	… –––m2	(1)Data sets were normalized so that they have a zero mean and a standard deviation of 1:	Pi – mp	(2)Pni = ——— spwhere mp is the sample mean and sp is the sample standard deviation.  Normalization was performed due to the soundness of the results; however, the data remained topologically invariant (Peters, 1991). The inverse data were obtained for comparative purposes and for an examination of extreme values. Several different statistical techniques were used to obtain a more accurate representation of the suggested hypothesis of non-normality:method of moments (basic description of the distribution); visual inspection (comparison between the properties of normally distributed data and productivity data under inspection); goodness of  t tests Kolmogorov–Smirnov test, Anderson–Darling test.Productivity is analysed in a purely statistical manner. That is why the study does not provide any qualitative information about the construction sites but rather examines common statistical characteristics. The purpose is to demonstrate some general properties common to all data sets irrespective of project nature or geographical origin. In essence, the intention is to show that these common characteristics could be revealed by statistical analysis even when the nature of the projects is not known.De ning a distributionIn order to analyse the validity of the assumption that labour productivity is normally distributed, we need a thorough insight into a normal distribution. What actually characterizes normality? Often these characteristics are not properly considered, and thus the results may rely on assumptions that are incorrect. Standard practice in the literature on statistics is to summarize the probability density function by its moments (Kottegoda and Rosso, 1997). Despite the fact that the mean and standard deviation ( rst two moments) fully describe a normal distribution, at least two others should be given attention (skewness and kurtosis) if the distribution is to be suf ciently de ned (Hahn and Shapiro, 1994). The  rst four moments or population measures are the mean (expected value), variance (measure of dispersion), skewness (measure of asymmetry) and kurtosis (measure of peakedness). These four moments should be de ned before performing any statistical analyses in order to verify the validity of applied techniques. Nevertheless, this is rarely a common procedure in productivity related research. That is why this study emphasizes the importance of the  rst four population measures and provides a thorough description of them in the  rst place. The objective here is to demonstrate the nature of the population measures and, consequently, to show what they tell us about a particular data set.  Let us call mr* the moment of order r about the point a. It is de ned for a discrete variable by [(Kottegoda and Rosso, 1997):	m*r = E (X – a)r = S(xi – a)rPX(xi)	(3)                                       all xi where r is a positive integer denoting the order of a moment and PX(xi) is a probability density function of a random variable X.  Now let X be a random variable with probability density function PX(xi). The expected value of X represents the  rst moment of a random variable X:	E[X] = Sxi pX (xi)	(4)	all	xiIf the sum on the right is in nite or does not exist, than the expected value of X also does not exist or is unidenti able (Conover, 1980). The  rst moment is the mean of X: mx = E(X)	mx = Sxi pX(xi)	(5)	all	xiIn the same way we can de ned the second moment (it is called the second central moment of tendency because a is actually the mean) or variance by writing: m2 = s2 = E (x –mX)2 m2 = SX  (X –mX)2f(X) =E(X2) – mX2 (6)The third moment denotes the symmetry of a particular distribution function and is called skewness, de ned by:g1 5 Ï m323 5 Ï {E[(X 22  EE[[XX])])32]]}3 m	E[(X E[X3] 2 3E[X2] · E[X] 1 2E[X])3	g1 5 	(E[X2] 2 (E[X])2)3/2	(7)  If the probability distribution is symmetrical about the mean, the third moment is equal to zero. If the values of X greater than the mean are more dispersed, then the distribution is positively skewed (dominant tail on the right). If the dominant tail is on the left side, the distribution is negatively skewed.  Kurtosis, or measure of peakedness, is the fourth moment of a distribution. Kurtosis is a condition where extra observations are present in the tails of the distribution and often it is called a fat-tails phenomenon. By using moments of order 4 and 2 we can de ne it by:g2 5 m42 5 {E[(X 22  EE[[XX])])24]}] 2 (8) m E[(X 2     E[X4] 2 4E[X3]E[X] 1 A g2 5 {E[X2] 2 (E[X])2}26E[X2](E[X])2 2 3(E[X])4	1 	{E[X2] 2 (E[X])2}2  Represented population measures of the random variables from which the sample is realized correspond to sample estimates (mean, standard deviation, coef cient of skewness and coef cient of kurtosis; Kottegoda and Rosso, 1997) when samples are numerically analysed.1.

This  rst step is of great importance because it reveals basic properties of normally distributed random numbers that are to be rejected in the case of productivity data. Normal distribution is a continuous probability distribution with the probability density function (Conover, 1980, Kottegoda and Rosso, 1997): f(x) 5  e(x2 )2/2 2    for all  x and s > 0 (13)ÏIt is obvious that, using the method of moments, the mean and standard deviation are de ned as: e	E 2¥ Ï 2p1s2	(x2 )2/2 2 dx 5 m	(14)¥and	E ¥ (x 2 m)2 Ï	1 2 e(x2 )2/2 2 dx 5 s2	(15)	2¥	2psThe normal distribution with m = 0 and s = 1 is called a standard normal distribution:	1	x2/2	(16)fs(x) 5 Ï 2pp eThe important properties of a normal distribution are the following (Kottegoda and Rosso, 1997).1. A linear transformation y = a + b?X	or anN(m,s2) variate X makes Y an N(a + bm, b2 s2) variate.2. The moment generating function is given by: MX(t) = e(mt + s2?t2/2)3. Let Yn be the sum of the n random variablesX1, X2,. . ., Xn with mean mn and standard deviation mn. As n approaches in nity the distribution function of the random variable (gn – mn)/sn approaches the standard normal distribution function. If Xi is normally distributed the result holds regardless of sample size. This is the ‘central limit theorem’.	–	2 of n independent4. The mean X and variance S normal variates X1, X2,. . ., Xn are independent.The above de nitions  nally give the resulting properties of a normal distribution that can be summed up in the following manner (Martin, 1971).l According to the central limit theorem mean m and variance s2 must be  nite.l The odd-order moments are zero; therefore skewness equals zero (by virtue of the symmetry). l The fourth moment (kurtosis) equals three (g2 = 3).  If productivity is truly normally distributed then the following analyses should give the above results. If not, then we cannot use some of the statistics because they are based on independent identically distributed random variables.Statistical description of original and inverse dataThe purpose of the initial analyses is to study the basic statistical properties of the original and inverse data (Tables 1 and 2). The results clearly show enormous differences between the two forms of data representation. If we take into account the form in which productivity originally was presented (total time in hours)/ (unit of work done), extreme values seem to be rather a frequent phenomenon. However, the original data exhibit results that are more consistent. Even at  rst glance we can detect high values of skewness and kurtosis in original data. However, the values are low, erratic, or even negative in the inverse data. Large positive values of skewness in the original data signal that the distribution is fat-tailed to the right. Hence, the distribution is non-symmetrical. Figures 1 and 2 demonstrate a frequency distribution of normalized data in comparison with a frequency distribution of Gaussian random numbers.  High values of kurtosis indicate a leptokurtotic condition. Leptokurtosis is the phenomenon of higher peaks and fatter tails than predicted by a normal distribution (Peters, 1991). The results of this study show that values closely around the mean and extremes are much more frequent than might be expected.Nevertheless, leptokurtosis is not so noticeable in some of the inverse data. The skewness of the inverse data is exhibiting similar behaviour to that of the kurtosis, and in some cases of inverse data the values are even negative. Further investigation of project 12, which was divided into four separate and supposedly independent sets, demonstrates that the inverse data are  uctuating more than the original (Table 3). Such inconsistent behaviour of skewness and kurtosis was the reason that only the original data were analysed further. Nevertheless, these values already signify that construction productivity does not show a normal distribution. However, the last basic property that needs to be validated is the central limit theorem, by testing the stability of mean and variance.Stability of mean and varianceThe two numerical values are basic statistical properties. Normal distribution can be suf ciently de ned by these two parameters (Kottegoda and Rosso, 1997). It belongs to the family of stable distributions and one of its properties is a scaling characteristic (Peters, 1991) de ned by the central limit theorem (Martin, 1971; Bethea et al., 1995; Kottegoda and Rosso, 1997). If x is a random variable with a density function f(x), then its expected value, E[x], can be represented in the following way (Martin, 1971):¥	E[x] 5 E x f(x) dx	(17)2¥Further, for a function h(x) of x the expected value is:¥	E[x] 5 E dx h(x) f(x)	(18)2¥It follows that the expected value of the sum of functions h1(x)and h2(x)equals the sum of their expected values:	E[h1 (x) + h2 (x)] = E[h1 (x)] + E[h2 (x)]	(19)

By applying this to the random distribution of sums of random samples of size n,n	S = Sxi	(20)i=1then it follows that the sampling distribution of S has the following mean and variance:	mS =nm,	s2s = ns2	(21)This is the outcome of the central limit theorem. Figures 3–6 reveal that productivity has a stable mean but an unstable (unde ned) variance that is de nitely not linear in scaling as in Eq. 21.  A comparison between the original data and the normal distribution illustrates similarity in the scaling of the mean. The variance, on the other hand, does not follow the theoretical values that were calculated using Eq. 21 (Figures 7 and 8). Furthermore, variance of normally distributed data converges to a certain value. Such a phenomenon does not occur in the original data, where the variance is growing rapidly and hence clearly showing unstable properties.  We have arrived at the signi cant assumption that labour productivity is not normally distributed. The above analytical and visual methods disclose that normal distribution cannot be assumed when describing the properties of construction productivity data for three reasons.l Unstable variance which is growing much faster than in the case of a normal distribution (central limit theorem is not applicable).l Nonzero skewness (distribution is not symmetrical).l Leptokurtotic phenomenon (higher peaks than in the case of normal distribution).

However, before stating the conclusion, we need to perform the tests of normality in order to prove the above assumptions completely.Tests of normalityThere are several tests for normality available in the literature on statistics. Nevertheless, one has to be very careful when applying certain tests for the results to be of any use. First, we have to be certain that suf ciently large data sets are available for testing. Tests differ in their ability to deal with large or small sample sizes (Conover, 1980; Sprent, 1989; Kottegoda andFigure 8 Variance of normal data follows the theoretical scaling (see text), does not grow rapidly and  attens outRosso, 1997). For the purposes of this study, two common goodness-of- t tests have been chosen: the Kolmogorov–Smirnov test, and the Anderson–Darling test  The Kolmogorov–Smirnov goodness-of- t test is a non-parametric test related to the cumulative density function. The limitation of the basic test is that the hypothesized distribution function must be completely speci ed, i.e., when there are no unknown parameters that should be estimated from the sample (Conover, 1980). However, later modi cations now allow testing the composite hypothesis of normality. The null hypothesis states that a particular population belongs to the normal distribution without specifying the mean or variance of a distribution. The test statistic is the maximum vertical distance between empirical Fn(x) and theoretical F0(x) cumulative density function (Kottegoda and Rosso, 1997).	Dn = sup|Fn(x) – F0(x)	(22)xThe critical values for large samples (n > 35) are1.3581/! n and 1.6276/! n for probabilities of 0.95 and0.99, respectively (levels of signi cance a = 0.05 and0.01).  The second test applied in this study is the Anderson–Darling goodness-of- t test, which gives heavier weighting to the tails of a distribution (Kottegoda and Rosso, 1997). Therefore it is appropriate for testing the normality of the productivity data due to the fat-tail phenomenon. The test statistic isA2 5 2n 2o 5n (2i 2 1) {ln F0(x(i)) 1 ln[1 2 F0(x(n2i11))]}	(23) n	i	1where x(i) are the observations presented in increasing order. For large samples the 5% and 1% values of the statistic are A20.05 = 2.492 and A20.01 = 3.857, respectively. These estimations are good for n>10. The summary of the two tests performed on the 12 productivity data sets is presented in Table 4. The results reveal that the both tests are in agreement with the analyses of central moments of tendency, showing that normal distribution is not appropriate as a statistical description of labour productivity.Discussion of resultsThe above analyses and tests show clearly that construction labour productivity is not normally distributed. All methods consistently illustrate that departure from normality is present in all data sets, regardless of the site or type of work, in the following manner.1. The failure of the central limit theorem due to the unstable and immoderate growth of variance.2. The leptokurtotic condition indicates that more data points are located around the mean and in the tails than predicted by the normal distribution.3. Both tests show that productivity is not normally distributed (p is in nitesimal in all cases).  Similar results of left skewness and non-normal distribution of productivity have also been detected by Lema and Price (1996); however, they did not investigate the stability of variance while proposing the Johnson SB distribution. Nevertheless, unstable variance indicates that Johnson SB distribution is not applicable because it is based on a standard normal variable. Behaviour of that kind in essence resembles the Pareto-Lévy distribution which characteristic function can be presented (Mendelbrot, 1960) in the following form (Pareto-Lévy law): w(j) 5 exp 3 iMj 2 |j| (u*) 5 1 2 1 2 tan 1 2 6 | cos 1 2 | 4 (24) ibj ap ap	|j|	2	2Where a is a measure of ‘peakedness’ (0<a<2), b is a measure of ‘skewness’ (21<b< + 1), u* is a measure of standard deviation, and M is a measure of location (the mean).Table 4	Summary of the two goodness-of- t tests, showing strong departure from normality in all casesData set No.1 (F)2 (F)3 (F)4 (F)5 (F)6 (M)7 (M)8 (M)9 (M)10 (M) 11 (M) 12 (M)Kolmogorov–	n148263183861099511011291132	108	470Smirnov test D0.2210.4620.2210.2360.3300.1940.4850.1560.235	0.317	0.187	0.176D0.050.1120.0840.1000.1460.1300.1390.1320.1280.142	0.118	0.131	0.063D0.010.1340.1000.1200.1760.1560.1670.1550.1540.171	0.142	0.157	0.075p<0.01<0.01<0.01<0.01<0.01<0.01<0.01<0.01<0.01<0.01	<0.01	<0.01Anderson–	A214.5183.6317.008.8521.677.3737.944.788.0624.29	7.72	33.55Darling test A20.052.4922.4922.4922.4922.4922.4922.4922.4922.492	2.492	2.492	2.492A20.013.8573.8573.8573.8573.8573.8573.8573.8573.857	3.857	3.857	3.857p0.000.000.000.000.000.000.000.000.00	0.00	0.00	0.00  A special case of Pareto-Lévy distributions is the normal distribution. Stable laws have no moments of any order if 0<a£ 1, they have only one  nite moment if 1<a<2, and they have a  nite variance in the Gaussian case (normal distribution), a = 2 (Mandelbrot, 1963). Stability of variance is of vital importance in statistical data analyses because most of the standard statistical tools are based on the assumption of stable and  nite variance (Mandelbrot, 1960; Peters, 1991). Therefore, normal distribution is only a special case of Pareto-Lévy distributions, which are considered also as fractal because they are statistically selfsimilar with respect to time (Peters, 1991). Hence, the mean of summed 5-day productivity would be  ve times the mean of daily productivity (as shown in Figures 3, 5 and 7); however, variance would scale only if a = 2. As presented earlier, the variance of productivity does not follow scaling and therefore is undened.Chaos theory?The above analyses reveal that productivity is characterized by unde ned variance which is actually common to chaotic systems (Peters, 1991). Can we then say that productivity is chaotic? It might well be, because we are dealing with construction projects of a very complex and seemingly uncontrollable nature, and of which the outcome is  uctuating productivity. Similar results have been found in some other scienti c disciplines, as reported by authors like Sharpe (1970), Peters (1991), Kaye (1993) and Lorenz (1995). All these systems indicate a complex nature that cannot be explained using standard statistical techniques. Peters (1991) revealed the curious behaviour of some economic indexes, which exhibit strong departure from normality, and his  ndings were based on unstable variance, skewness and the presence of extreme values. In particular, Peters studied the complex behaviour of the 5-day logarithmic  rst-differences in price for the S&P 500 index. The high-peak (leptokurtosis) and fat-tail (negative skewness) phenomena found were like those in productivity. In addition, the nonlinear dynamics applied revealed that behaviour of the S&P 500 index seems chaotic. Similar results within econometric studies were detected also by Dechert and Gencay (1993) and by Papaioannou and Karytinos (1995). The typical example of a chaotic signal is presented in Figure 9. The ‘bumping’ behaviour is similar to productivity. Ruelle (1989) reported that all correlation tests would reveal rapid de-correlation between successive iterations, hence assigning it randomness. The signal is actually an outcome of the simple deterministic difference equation (so-called logistic or May’s equation):	xn+1 =4 xn(1 – xn)	(25)  The above equation was  rst used in the early 1970s for describing population variations when the growth produced population stress, which modi ed the actual growth curve. Population biologists have developed a graphic method of following the  uctuations predicted by May’s equation, described as the ‘parabolic cobweb’ diagram (Kaye, 1993). Surprisingly, values of k greater than 3.58 generate chaotic behaviour (we have used k = 4; Eq. 25). The properties of this simple equation have been applied successfully in population biology and studied by many mathematicians (Kaye, 1993).  Although the objective of the present study is not the application of chaos theory or the above equation, these very brie y interpreted examples from other research disciplines may serve as a guide for future research. However, more profound de nitions and descriptions of chaotic behaviour and analyses can be found elsewhere (Ruelle, 1989; Schuster, 1989; Baker and Golub, 1990; Ott, 1991).ConclusionsConstruction labour productivity is not normally distributed, because of the following factors that were discovered by determining the central moments of tendency and applying two different tests of normality.1. The failure of the central limit theorem due to
Figure 9 Simple deterministic difference equation exhibiting chaotic behaviour (k = 4) and to which all correlation tests would assign randomnessan unstable and immoderate growth of variance (unde ned variance).2. The leptokurtotic condition, which indicates that the occurrence of values around the mean and extreme values of several standard deviations from the mean is much more frequent than predicted by the normal distribution.3. The tests of normality show that productivity is not normally distributed (p is in nitesimal in all cases).However, some standard characteristics (stable and  nite variance, using test statistics that rely on normality, etc.) usually have been taken for granted, and consequently not much could have been done to achieve a better understanding of the ubiquitous complexity. Clearly, characteristics like large positive skewness, leptokurtosis, frequent extreme values and unde ned variance demonstrate non-randomness, which means that statistical diagnostics like correlation coef cients and t statistics and some basic paradigms like the central limit theorem are not applicable. However, based on evidence from other scienti c disciplines like econometrics and population biology, there is the promising possibility of applying chaos theory in the further examination of productivity data. Chaotic systems are described by Pareto-Lévy distributions whose characteristic shape is a fat-tailed, high-peak curve, like that for productivity. This may lead to a new paradigm of chaotic productivity in view of some deterministic properties hidden within random-looking productivity, and hopefully future research will focused on the chaotic characteristics of construction labour productivity.AcknowledgementsI acknowledge a great debt of thanks to ProfessorRandolph H.
