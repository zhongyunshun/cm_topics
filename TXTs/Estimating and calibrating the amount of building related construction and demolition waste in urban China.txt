It is an enigma why such statistics as C&D waste generation are absent from the literature in spite of their importance to devising sensible interventions to deal with the C&D waste-related problems. This paper aims to estimate the amount of C&D waste at the country level. It does so by adopting a methodology utilizing national statistical data and the average amounts of waste generated at work sites. Furthermore, the estimation undergoes a thorough calibration against various independent sources before it can be accepted confidently. It is finally estimated that approximately 1.13 billion tons of C&D materials were generated in China during 2014, which has declined from a plateau of building activities and C&D waste generation in the early 2010s. The paper provides some useful references for devising appropriate C&D waste reduction, reuse, or recycling strategies. The paper also offers useful commentary on methodology to estimate C&D waste generation at an urban level, particularly in situations where data availability is erratic.Keywords: construction and demolition waste; estimation; calibration; waste management; urbanization; ChinaIntroductionConstruction and demolition (C&D) waste is one of the major side effects of urbanization; it contributes significantly to environmental degradation (Lu & Yuan 2010; Coelho & de Brito 2012; Lu & Tam 2013; Udawatta et al. 2015) and thus requires careful management. Much research effort has been paid to estimating the amount of C&D waste generation as a starting point of construction waste management. For example, the US Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA 2009) estimated the amount of C&D waste to target materials for reduction, reuse, and recovery as part of its Resource Conservation Challenge. The old saying that ‘you cannot improve what you cannot measure’ offers a rationale for research conducted to estimate the amount of C&D waste. Likewise, Li et al. (2013) emphasized that information about C&D waste generation is a prerequisite to developing appropriate solutions for managing waste. They noted that studies of this kind can be divided into two categories: studies that determine an overall C&D waste generation total in a region and those that measure a C&D waste generation index at project sites. This paper focuses on the estimation of C&D waste generation at an urban level.   For some urban areas (e.g. Australia, Europe, the UK, or Hong Kong) where C&D waste data has been systematically collected and released regularly, estimation of waste generation is unnecessary, unless it is to challenge or verify official statistics. However, contrasting with our orthodox wisdom, statistics on total C&D waste generation in many countries, including some developed economies, are not always readily available. For example, there seems no systematic publication of statistics on total C&D waste generation in the US. One has to refer to an ad hoc, extant study by USEPA (2009), estimating that approximately 170 million tons of building-related C&D materials were generated in the US during 2003. Likewise, there are no statistics on C&D materials in Japan continuously published by authorities. These estimations are particularly unavailable in developing countries, where building-related C&D waste is emerging as an urgent issue. In this paper, ‘building’ is both a noun to represent a physical structure and a gerund to describe the building activity.   Recently, building-related C&D waste in China has again come into the international media spotlight. In Shenzhen, a city in South China, the collapse of a huge pile of construction debris unlawfully disposed of in a former stone quarry toppled 33 buildings and trapped dozens of people (Buckley & Ramzy 2015a). There was a quick estimation of C&D waste generation per annum by the media organization Phoenix TV to show the insufficiency of landfill space that is properly managed but apart from this, no other statistics have been officially published in either Shenzhen or other urban areas in China, despite the fact that the Administration of Urban Construction Garbage was promulgated in 2005. Estimation of building-related C&D waste generation is long overdue in China. Researchers have provided insights into the process of*Corresponding author.

However, the externality effects of urban land conversion in terms of C&D waste generation are under-researched. The few studies that do exist still cite an outdated approximate waste generation rate of 500‒600 tons per 10,000 m2 provided 15 years ago by Lu (1999), who, without describing the methodology, used a simple rule-of-thumb (Lu et al. 2011). Guo (2009) reported that waste generation was around 100 million tons from new construction and 500 million tons from demolition.   The aim of this research is thus to estimate the C&D waste generation in China. Owing to erratic data availability, in particular data for public work projects such as roads, railways, bridges, utilities, piers, and dams, our estimate is confined to building-related C&D waste only. The rest of the paper is structured in four sections. The next section is a literature review of previous studies estimating C&D waste, with special consideration given to their methodologies. The following section describes the selected methodology, which is adapted from USEPA (2009) and Bergsdal et al. (2007). However, this research extends it by using estimation calibrations against various independent sources. Analyses and results are reported in the fourth section, with due comment on data quality and the suitability of alternative proxies. Then the results are calibrated. In the penultimate section the results are further discussed and the implications are explored. Conclusions are drawn in the final section.Literature review Estimation of C&D waste generation at a regional levelResearchers have estimated overall amounts of C&D waste generation in various regions. For example, Cochran et al. (2007) explored the accounting, generation, and composition of building-related C&D waste in Florida, US. Six specific categories of debris were examined: residential construction, non-residential construction, residential demolition, non-residential demolition, residential renovation, and non-residential renovation. As a result, Florida was estimated to generate approximately 3,750,000 metric tons of building-related C&D debris in 2000 (Cochran et al. 2007). Bergsdal et al. (2007) projected C&D waste in Norway using a methodology that can be described in three steps. The first is to estimate the amount of activities (m2/year) of (1) construction, (2) renovation, and (3) demolition of buildings. The second step is to determine the specific waste generation factor (kg/m2) for different fractions of solid waste related to each type of activity. The third step is to calculate overall waste generation projection (tons/year) of materials outflow from the building stock. In an attempt to estimate the quantities of construction waste generated in Thailand, Kofoworola and Gheewala (2009) multiplied the quantity of different types of building activity with waste generation rates (e.g. new residential building activity generated 21.38 kg/m2 of waste and new non-residential building generated 18.99 kg/m2). Similar studies include Hsiao et al. (2002), Reinhart et al. (2003), and M€uller (2006).   Estimation of overall C&D waste generation was also conducted by national environmental authorities. The USEPA (1998, 2009) conducted two studies to estimate building-related C&D waste generation in the US in 1996 and 2003 respectively. It adopted a method similar to Bergsdal et al. (2007). C&D debris is produced when new structures are built and when existing structures are renovated or demolished. Here, structures include all residential and non-residential buildings as well as public works projects, such as streets and highways, bridges, piers and dams. Given the limited data availability, only building-related C&D materials were estimated by USEPA (2009). These were classified into three activities: construction, demolition, and renovation, in residential and non-residential buildings respectively, making six categories of waste to be estimated (USEPA, 2009). The methodology utilized national statistical data on the amount of construction, renovation, and demolition activities in the US and average amounts of waste generated at work sites in estimation. The latter were calibrated from various work site C&D materials surveys conducted by other parties ‒ e.g. the National Association of Home Builders (NAHB 1997), and Metro (Portland Oregon).Estimation of C&D waste generation on a project levelEstimating C&D waste generation on a project level also attracted considerable research interest (e.g. Skoyles 1976; Bossink & Brouwers 1996; Poon et al. 2004; Lin 2006; Tam et al. 2007; Lu et al. 2011; Li et al. 2013). Lu et al. (2011) conducted a review of the research by focusing on the waste generation rate (WGR) as an index for measuring C&D waste generation on a project level. In addition to its use in benchmarking construction waste management (CWM) practices, raising people’s awareness of CWM, and assisting contractors in developing effective strategies, WGR can also help estimate overall C&D waste generation on a regional level. Cheng and Ma (2013) made a summary of existing methods for C&D waste estimation, including the ones based on the constructed area, on the Global Index, the component index in a building, in a region through material stocks and flows, on quantities obtained from related databases, according to physical layout forms, or on accounting tools.   Chinese researchers started to investigate C&D waste generation on a project level, which is critical for the estimation of the amount of building-related C&D waste in the urban environment as a whole. For example, Lu et al. (2011) investigated WGRs by conducting on-site waste sorting and weighing at four construction projects in Shenzhen, South China. The results revealed that WGRs ranged from 3.275 to 8.791 kg/m2, and that miscellaneous waste, timber for formwork and falsework and concrete were the three largest components amongst generated waste (Lu et al. 2011). Li et al. (2013) developed a construction waste generation index model for quantifying waste generation per gross floor area (GFA) in China, based on the mass-balance principle for building construction. A newly constructed residential building in Shenzhen was used as a case study to illustrate the model, and the waste generation of this case was 40.7 kg/m2. Of that amount, concrete represented 43.5%, timber formwork 18.7%, steel bar 9.8%, brick and block 8.4%, mortar 8.4% and tile 1.2% (Li et al. 2013). Ding and Xiao (2014) estimated that approximately 13.71 million tons of building-related C&D waste was generated in 2012 in Shanghai, of which more than 80% was concrete, bricks and blocks. The research opened a window through which C&D waste generation totals in China can be estimated.MethodsIn order to estimate the amount of building-related C&D waste generation, Equation (1) is formulated for guiding data collection and waste generation estimation.	Wt D Wc C Wd C Wr DAC£WGRc CAD£WGRd CAR£WGRr	(1)Where Wt is the estimated total amount of building-related C&D waste generation, Wc is the waste generated from new construction of buildings, Wd is the waste generated from demolition of buildings, and Wr is the waste generated from renovation of buildings, AC is total floor area of building under construction (m2), and WGRc is waste generation rate (ton/ m2) in building construction; AD is the total floor area of demolished building (m2), and WGRd is waste generation rate (ton/m2) in building demolition; AR is total floor area of building under renovation (m2), and WGRr is waste generation rate (ton/m2) in building renovation.   The method is similar to the ones adopted by Bergsdal et al. (2007) and USEPA (2009). A considerable amount of effort was made by USEPA (2009) to determine total floor area (m2) of residential construction, renovation, and demolition. This was because the US Census Bureau, similar to its counterparts in Australia and the UK, only releases the number, not area, of home construction. In China, homes and non-residential buildings are sold by floor area (m2). They are mostly high-rise buildings, predominantly consisting of a composite structure of steel and concrete using cast in-situ technologies, although low-waste technologies such as full steel structures, and prefabrication have been adopted by some landmark office buildings and exemplar residential buildings respectively. Because of the similarities in construction between the two sectors, residential and non-residential buildings are combined in estimating the total amount of buildingrelated C&D waste in China. It is noted that a similar approach was also adopted in Phoenix TV’s estimation, as mentioned above.   The research methods provide an analytical process for estimating the building-related C&D waste generation in China with limited information. Another constant problem is to sample properly in China, which is well known for its considerable regional imbalance between the Eastern Seaboard urban spaces and those in the inner parts of China. The intention of the Central Government is to have a set of uniform laws and regulations governing construction activities and their environmental issues. However, different regions have different construction management capacities, technologies, productivity, and in turn C&D waste generation levels. The problem of estimating the amount of building-related C&D waste generation at the country level is converted to estimating the waste generation in each characteristic zone. This conversion is especially important as waste generation by different construction practices varies in a big country like China. Assuming there are m zones with similar characteristics in each corresponding zone, and AC (total floor area of building under construction), AD (the total floor area of demolished building), and AR (total floor area of building under renovation) can be found in Equations (2), (3), and (4), respectively:AC D fAC1;AC2;AC3;...ACmg(2)ADDfAD1; AD2; AD3;...ADmg(3)ARDfAR1; AR2; AR3;...ARmg(4)Their waste generation rates can be found in Equations (5), (6), and (7), respectively:WGRc D fWGRc1;WGRc2;WGRc3;...WGRcmg(5)WGRd D fWGRd1;WGRd2;WGRd3;...WGRdmg(6)WGRr DfWGRr1;WGRr2;WGRr3;...WGRrmg(7)   Building-related C&D waste generation at the country level can therefore be estimated through Equation (8), which is a detailed version of Equation (1), decomposing it into different zones:	i D m	i D m	i D m	Wt D X ACi£WGRci C X ADi£WGRdi C X ARi£WGRri	(8)	i D 1	i D 1	i D 1   Ideally, a field study of all these regions is necessary to identify the WGRs. However, in reality, it is difficult to do so with limited funding and time. This study mainly utilizes secondary data from other similar research. Bearing in mind the regional imbalance, the researchers however excluded the apparent outliers of the secondary data. The process relies heavily on the researchers’ discretion on the subject matter but inter-rater reliability was tested in the process ‒ i.e. three authors of the paper examined the results against the data sources independently and consensus was reached; otherwise, average summation was adopted to reduce potential variations.   Estimation is inherently inexact; the aim is to continuously improve the results to approaching a reality, although ‘reality’ itself is subject to a long history of inconclusive philosophical debate ‒ e.g. ontology vs. epistemology. It is thus critical to calibrate the estimate results against various independent data sources so that the results can be accepted with an appropriate degree of confidence. In this study, considerable efforts have been paid to the calibrations of all the variables and C&D waste generation totals against various available first or secondary data sources. Likewise, during the calibration process, based on the researchers’ discretion, some apparent outliers were excluded as the edges forming a reasonable range. If an estimate falls within the range, it can be accepted. Otherwise, we revisited both the estimate and the range to try to determine the acceptability of the results.Analyses and results Wc, AC, and WGRcThe China Statistical Yearbook on Construction publishes annual construction data, including total building construction floor areas (CFA) under construction and CFA completed. Data for the past eight years ranging from 2007 to 2014 was retrieved and tabulated (Table 1). The fact that China publishes overall building CFA confirms our above consideration to combine residential and non-residential buildings in estimating their waste generation. Following the method adopted by Niu (2008), we define AC (Total floor area of building under construction) as CFA under construction. For waste generation parameters, we use the waste generation rate for new construction reported by Li et al. (2013), which is 40 kg/ m2. We use it as a constant within the time frame by seeing no significant C&D waste management and technologies introduced during the period. The total waste generated from construction of buildings in these years is estimated and shown in Table 1. Taking the year 2014 as an example, it was estimated as Wc D AC £ WGRc D 1355559.65 £ 10000 m2 £ 40.7 kg/m2 D 551,712,778 tons.Table 1.

With a considerable portion of new buildings being built on the sites of demolished buildings, this has given rise to not only environmental and conservation concerns but also widespread social discontent. Qiu (2010), ex-Vice Minister of the MOHURD, China, said that new buildings are typically demolished after 25‒30 years even though the designed service life is 50 years or longer. However, except for Shanghai, there was no national or provincial statistical data published to report on the scale of building demolition (see Table 2). On the other hand, there is data with regard to CFA completed, or CFA under construction of buildings and other economic indicators (e.g. GDP, construction output) at the national level (see Table 3). Research effort should be devoted to estimating the total demolition activities at urban level in China using the limited data available.   The demolition areas are not necessary all developed into new buildings immediately; technical issues (e.g. contaminated site, or uncertain geotechnical conditions necessitating survey of the site) and institutional bureaucracy (e.g. planning control) may delay the redevelopment of the areas. New buildings are often designed with higher plot ratios so the CFA under construction and completed is normally larger than the demolition area, let alone that new buildings are also built on lands supplied elsewhere. It is also not uncommon that developers may expedite or slow down the redevelopment of the demolition sites, depending on the market conditions. However, demolition of buildings in a particular year is closely related to the determinant factors mentioned. The difficulty is to ascertain the exact algorithms that can model the demolition areas based on the determinant factors in the whole country, as there is no public data available to do so.   Without knowing the exact algorithms, an alternative method is to estimate the demolition area in the whole country using the data in Shanghai by assuming that the determinant factors in Shanghai will play the similar, if not the same, roles in the whole country. The percentage of demolition areas in Shanghai against those in the whole country should be similar to the percentage of determinant factors (e.g. GDP, total construction output, CFA under construction, and CFA completed) in Shanghai against those at the national level. Except for the regional difference as a potential caveat, this assumption is optimal as there is no public data on demolition areas except for that on Shanghai. Within this context, the rule of thumb for estimating the demolition areas in China can be demonstrated in the following formula:Dit DDSit £Fit=FSitWhere Dit is the estimated demolition areas at the country level in a particular year t based on the ith determinant factor, DSit is the published demolition areas of Shanghai in a particular year t, Fit is the published data of selected determinant factor of China in a particular year t, FSit is the published data of selected determinant factor of Shanghai in a particular Table 3.

The estimate finally accepted is the average of the four forecast results demonstrated in Table 4, as it is difficult to distinguish where one is better than another. Similar to the situation in Shanghai, one can notice that the demolition areas in China have declined from a plateau in the early 2010s. The reasons are many. It may attributed to the cool-down of the overheated real estate market in China in recent years. With increasing environmental and conservation concerns as well as widespread social discontent, urban authorities are also more careful in considering redevelopment options instead of simply razing an area to build new facilities.   Zhu (2010) identified two approaches to estimate waste generation rates in demolition (WGRd): (a) demolition site investigations, and (b) using the material balance principle. It is straightforward to measure WGRd by measuring total waste generated and dividing by the GFA of a demolished building. However, no previous research has been reported to measure WGRd in China using this approach. Alternatively, the material balance principle estimates WGRd by assuming that materials used in the construction of a building remain unchanged during its service life, largely becoming waste after demolition. Zhu (2010) converted the materials into weight and estimated a WGRd for multi-storey masonry structure buildings, multi-storey building with shops, and multi-storey framework structure buildings: respectively, 1263.9 kg/m2, 1198.1 kg/m2, and 1052.9 kg/m2 (Zhu 2010), after deducting the weight of steel that will be fully recycled in reality. By comparison, in a study by Chen (2007), waste generation rates measured using an on-site method were estimated as masonry structure (1321.7 kg/m2), steel concrete structure (1755.1 kg/m2), brick and wood structure (905.3 kg/m2), and steel structure (878.9 kg/m2). It can be seen that the results from Zhu (2010) and Chen (2007) are largely consistent. In our study we adopt an averaged set of WGR from the two sources ‒ Zhu (2010) and Chen (2007) ‒ as the WGRd for estimating overall demolition waste in China. That is:WGRd Dð1263:9C1198:1C1052:9C1321:7C1755:1C905:3C878:9Þ=7D1;196:57 kg=m2   Using the WGR and the estimated demolition areas, demolition waste in China over the past years was calculated and tabulated in the last row of Table 4. For example, the overall demolition waste in the whole of China in 2014 is estimated as:Wd DDV£WGRd D4467£10;000 m2£1;196:57 kg=m2 D53;450;782 tonsWr, AR, and WGRrRenovation is defined by USEPA (2009) as improvements and repairs to existing buildings. It generates C&D waste as old materials are removed and new materials added. C&D waste from building renovation is less regulated and underresearched. Only recently, in some major cities (e.g. Shanghai, Beijing), is has been ordered that homeowners should open a billing account in the facilities management (FM) department of an estate before any renovation can be started. For example, the Xi’an government requires this billing account to have a deposit of RMB 2000 for a home CFA smaller than 100 m2; RMB 2500 for a home CFA between 100 m2 and 150 m2; and RMB 3000 for a home CFA larger than 150 m2.Table 5.

While such systems might be a potentially good source of data for waste modelling, the practice in Xi’an, as an example, is undeveloped and loosely enforced.   One more viable approach is to use building CFA completed (see Table 1) as a proxy to estimate renovation activities in new buildings. This echoes Zhu’s (2010) method. In this case, the area of buildings under renovation is 4,233,573,000 m2 in year 2014. The challenge is to determine the annual rate of renovation activities in existing buildings in China. Various sources report that renovation takes place every 6‒10 years in hotels, offices, and other non-residential buildings, and every 10 years in private residential buildings (e.g. Huang 2011). But it is extremely difficult to find the renovated floor area of existing buildings in China. Thus, waste generation in the renovation of existing buildings is not considered in this study.   In recent years, several local governments (e.g. Luoyang and Tengzhou) have started to publish guidelines on the calculation of construction waste generation in new construction, demolition, and renovation. Although they rarely specify the data sources, they have tended to adopt two rule-of-thumb estimates of renovation waste: 100 kg/m2 for a home CFA smaller than 160 m, and 150 kg/m2 for a home CFA larger than 161 m2. In our study, we adopt the average of these values: 125 kg/m2 as the waste generation rate in building renovation (WGRr). The overall building renovation waste generated is estimated and tabulated in Table 5. Taking the whole of China in 2014 as an example, it is estimated that the overall waste generated from building renovation activities isWr DAR£WGRr D4;233;573;000m2£125 kg=m2 D529;196;625 tons:CalibrationThe estimate needs to be calibrated against as wide a range of sources as possible. Proxies from various sources have been adopted to approximate critical variables in the estimation. There is no lack of estimates of this kind in the literature, but most estimates cite similar sources without proper substantiation and/or explanation of data quality and method. Tables 6 to 9 list the principal sources of estimates of total construction waste in China and/or component variables.Total floor area of new building constructionFor new building construction, developers have to submit reports for approval by the government, which is thus able to collate relatively good statistics. Chinese Statistics Yearbooks and China Statistical Yearbook on Construction haveTable 6.	Alternative data sources for estimating construction waste generation by new construction in China.VariablesDescriptionsSourcesTotal building construction volumeEvery year a total of about 2 billion m2 floor area is built, consuming almost 40% of the world’s cement and steel.Qiu (2010)WGRcA waste generation rate of approximately 500‒600 tons per 10,000 m2.Lu (1999)A rough estimation shows that 500‒600 tons of construction waste will be generated in producing every 10,000 m2 of construction floor area.Qiu (2010)The results revealed that WGRs ranged from 3.275 to 8.791 kg/m2 and miscellaneous waste, timber for formwork and falsework, and concrete were the three largest components amongst the generated waste.Lu et al. (2011)Table 7.	Alternative data sources for estimating construction waste generation by building demolition in China.VariablesDescriptionsSourcesTotal building demolition volumeTotal demolition volume in a single year takes up around 40% of all the existing buildings in stock.Qiu (2010)China witnesses the demolition of 3 £ 107» 4 £ 107 m2 of old buildings, generating hundreds of million tons of demolition waste a year.Zhu (2010)In our country, there is about 40 billion m2 gross floor area in stock. Currently, demolished buildings from urban renewal are about 150 million m2 a year.Niu (2008)WGRdA rough estimation shows that 7000‒12,000 tons of waste will be generated in demolishing every 10,000m2 construction floor areas of old buildings.Qiu (2010)Waste generation in demolition is around 1 ton/m2. More specifically, more than 1 ton of waste will be generated in demolishing 1 m2 of multi-storey masonry structure buildings, and 1.2 ton for multi-storey framework structure buildings.Niu (2008)published building CFA under construction and completed continuously for more than 10 years. There is little controversy in accepting this source as a reference for calculating total building construction volume. Therefore, ‘building CFA under construction’ can be confidently used as the estimate of total new building construction. In contrast, the estimate in Table 6 made by Qiu (2010) is a rough one, which is surprisingly inconsistent with the official statistics.Waste generation rate in new building construction (WGRc)By converting the estimated waste generation rates to a uniform unit of kg/m2, a range of values for calibrating WGRc can be derived (Table 6). At one end of the range are the estimates by Lu (1999), and Qiu (2010), which assume that 50‒60 kg of waste is generated in constructing every m2 of CFA. A similar figure is used by the Shenzhen Construction Norm, which suggests a total WGR of 50.4 kg/m2 in new building construction. The three rates are largely based on outdated norms, and we therefore reject them. At the other end is the estimate used by Lu et al. (2011), giving a WGR of 3.275 to 8.791 kg/m2. Their research focused on a very limited construction stage in a confined floor area, and thus the WGR is deemed too low to reflect the whole construction cycle. Instead, our study adopts the more up-to-date WGR of 40.7 kg/m2 given by Li et al. (2013), derived through quantifying waste generation based on the material balance principle.Total floor area of building demolitionBy converting the estimated total building demolition areas in Table 7 to a uniform unit of m2 a range for calibrating total building demolition in China is derived. At one end of the range is 150 million m2 from Niu (2008); and at the other, 1.6 billion m2 from Qiu (2010). In the absence of a nationwide summary of total building demolition activity in China, we make an estimate using a rule-of-thumb formula largely based on Shanghai data. Our estimates (see Table 4) fall within the range and are closer to the estimate given by Niu (2008). However, it is noticed that the total demolition areas has declined from a plateau in the early 2010s.Waste generation rate in building demolition (WGRd)By converting the estimates of waste generation in building demolition to a uniform unit of kg/m2, a range for calibrating WGRd can be derived. These are largely convergent and we confidently accept 1196.57 kg/m2 as the WGRd in this study, given that it has been appropriately substantiated from multiple data sources. At this juncture, it can be seen that WGRd is about 29 times WGRc. This resonates with USEPA (2009), which reported that on a per building basis, demolition waste quantities are often 20 to 30 times as much as C&D material generated during construction.Total floor area of building renovationWang et al. (2004) estimated total renovation area at about 600 million m2 per annum, we have found no other source to help estimate the building renovation floor area, Chen (2011) only reported renovation output in value (yuan), which cannot be further converted to floor areas (m2) as there is no universal unit cost for renovation in China (Table 8). Huang (2011) also reported renovation output in value (yuan). The data quality for existing building renovation is particularlyTable 8.	Alternative data sources for estimating construction waste generation by building renovation in China.VariablesDescriptionsSourcesTotal building renovationAccording to the statistics, renovated areas reach to around 600 million m2 per annum in recent years.Wang et al. (2004)The construction renovation sector has developed rapidly over the past three decades, reaching an output of 2.1 trillion yuan last year. We believe that public residential buildings (e.g. hotels) will be renovated every 6‒8 years, while for regular residential buildings, they will be renovated every 10 years.Chen (2011)In calculating the numbers of renovated homes and commercial use buildings, there is a ratio of 7/3 between the two.Niu (2008)WGRrFor residential buildings, the WGR is around 0.1 t/m2, while this rate for shops or office buildings is around 0.15 t/m2.Zhu (2010)Generally, 2 tons of C&D waste will be generated in renovating a residential flat.Niu (2008)poor. Due to data quality, we have therefore decided not to include new building renovation activities in our overall estimate. The difficulty is highlighted by USEPA (2009), which reported that estimating renovation activities has the highest level of uncertainty.Waste generation rate in building renovation (WGRr)By converting the descriptions of estimated waste generation in building renovation to a uniform unit of kg/m2 a range for calibrating WGRr can be derived. These are very divergent: from 20 kg/m2 to 100‒150 kg/m2. This study adopts 125 kg/ m2 as WGRr for two reasons: (a) it falls well within the spectrum, and (b) it is used as a guideline by several local governments.Total building-related C&D waste generation in ChinaAs can be seen from Table 9, estimates of total building-related C&D waste in China vary significantly from one author and source to another. The estimate of 1.13 billion tons of waste generation in 2014 in this study diverges significantly from the prevailing view that total C&D waste generated is a few hundred million but less than 1 billion tons (Niu 2008; Guo 2009; Cheng 2012). Although our estimate sounds surprisingly high, it is supported by other sources, which apportion C&D waste at around 40% in total municipal solid waste (MSW) (e.g. Li 2008; Qiu 2010; Huang 2011). It is generally agreed that MSW statistics are more reliable as they are the first to have been collected by environmental protection departments. The figure of 40% also seems reasonable in light of the fact that this number is about 29% in the USATable 9.	Alternative data sources for estimating total construction waste generation in China.VariablesDescriptionSourcesTotal building-related C&D waste in ChinaWaste generated is around 100 million tons from new construction and 500 million tons from demolition.Guo (2009)Total building-related C&D waste in China was about 423 million tons in 2003, 509 million in 2004, 575 million in 2005, and 668 million in 2006.Niu (2008)Construction waste makes up around 30‒40% of total municipal solid waste in China.Qiu (2010)Around 200 million tons of C&D waste is generated in demolishing old buildings, and 100 million from new construction. We have 40 billion m2 gross floor areas in stock, annual demolition areas will be around 400 million m2, generating more than 600 million tons of C&D waste per year.Cheng (2012)In 2011, the total municipal solid waste (MSW) is about 7 billion tons, of which total construction waste is about 2.1 billion to 2.8 billion tons.Huang (2012)Every year, around 6 billion tons of MSW are generated, of which 2.4 billon tons is C&D waste, taking up around 40% of total MSW.Li (2008)Table 10.

In short, we offer the estimate of 1.13 billion tons as the most reliable estimate of China’s annual C&D waste given available data in 2014. Table 10 summarizes the component parts of the estimates from 2007 to 2014.DiscussionUnlike the situation in developed countries where demolition is usually the smallest contributor of the three sub-sectors (Bergsdal et al. 2007), demolition was the largest waste-generating sector in China in the early 2010s when urbanization has gained momentum and there was an overheated real estate market around the country (Table 10). Currently, demolition of buildings in Chinese cities is usually closely related with or even driven by urban development (Lai et al. 2014). The rapid rate of urbanization is attributable to a shortening of the urban redevelopment cycle and unusually waste-intensive construction. On the other hand, this has been exacerbated in China by a unique distribution of built-up areas (unique city morphology) that has its explanation in China’s particular experience in transitioning from a centrally planned land economy. Nevertheless, it is noticed that building demolition activities have decreased, and with it demolition waste generation, with the deepening of China’s urbanization. From Table 10, it can be seen that the portion of C&D waste from building renovation only is comparable to that of new building construction. It is envisaged that renovation of existing buildings will significantly increase with the improvement of household income in China. Dealing with renovation waste is a great challenge ahead for policy-makers, practitioners, environmentalists, and researchers.   The estimate of 1 billion tons of C&D waste generated in a single and typical year may be overly high. Fortunately, a significant portion of the waste is the excavated soil or inert C&D waste which can be reused and/or recycled. For example, inert construction waste consisting of materials such as debris, rubble, earth, bitumen, and concrete can be used for land reclamation, site formation, and aggregates given proper treatment (Lu & Yuan 2013; Tam & Hao 2014). This, however, will not take place automatically unless the maturity of the recycling industry leads to more environmentally friendly ways (e.g. deconstruction, or recycling demolition concrete). A tragedy caused by untreated construction debris has been reported in Shenzhen, a city that is supposed to stand on the frontier in dealing with construction waste (Lu et al. 2011; Yuan in Buckley & Ramzy 2015b). This reveals great scope for the development of new instruments to make the industry greener. While making the industry cleaner may result in dead-weight economic loss to the sector, create value can be created from waste, and thus some of the massive externality costs of China’s urbanization could be internalized by the industry.   As shown in Bergsdal et al. (2007), USEPA (2009), and this paper, estimation of building-related C&D waste generation at a regional level is by no means rocket science. Rather, the difficulty lies in finding reliable data sources for estimating (a) construction and demolition activities, and (b) unit waste generation rates from individual job sites. This is particularly difficult in China, a country with significant regional imbalance in terms of urbanization and consequently construction, renovation, and demolition activities. It is legitimate to use secondary data given the apparent difficulties for a first-hand data collection strategy to cover all types of building activities in all regions in China, even with a focus on urban areas; the data sources should be treated with caution though. One of the unique contributions of this paper is to calibrate the estimation against various independent data sources so that the results can be accepted with an appropriate degree of confidence. The estimate can be utilized to raise people’s awareness of CWM and to set up a baseline against which the effectiveness of future CWM initiatives can be benchmarked.ConclusionsConsidering the limitation of estimating C&D waste at the country level with limited information, a systematic analytical process has been introduced in this study. By adopting a methodology that utilizes national statistical data and average estimates of waste generated at job sites, this study attempts to estimate the amount of building-related construction and demolition waste in China. The results are further calibrated against various independent sources before it can be accepted. It was estimated that approximately 1.13 billion tons of building-related C&D materials were generated in China during 2014 without counting the amount from renovation of existing buildings. Demolition was the largest sector contributing to C&D waste generation, representing around 35% of the total waste generated in the early 2010s. However, after years of fast development, demolition activities have decreased. Renovation of existing buildings, on the other hand, will significantly increase with the improvement of household income in China. Dealing with renovation waste is a great challenge ahead.   The results in a single and typical year may be overly high, but fortunately a significant portion of the waste can be reduced, reused, or recycled. This reveals great challenges but also prospects for the sustainable development of a green construction industry. Accurate measurements of C&D waste are critical but, generally speaking, efforts to improving the measurements are currently hampered by a general lack of data. Therefore, it should be recognized that the estimates have some level of uncertainty, and the results should be viewed in that light. Nevertheless, it is believed that the estimates contained in this paper reflect the best data currently available.Disclosure statementNo potential conflict of interest was reported by the authors.FundingThis work was supported by the National Nature Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [project no.: 71273219].ReferencesBergsdal H, Bohne RA, Brattebo H. 2007.
