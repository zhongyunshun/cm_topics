For the duration of a project the site layout may need to be ef ciently re-organized at various intervals to satisfy the schedule requirements and to maintain site ef ciency. This paper presents a practical model for schedule-dependent site layout planning in construction. The proposed model uses a combination of arti cial intelligence tools (knowledge-based systems, fuzzy logic, and genetic algorithms) to generate, optimize, and re-organize the site layout plan at frequent intervals during the project. The model incorporates  exible representation of irregular site shapes and several options for placing facilities. Based on the proposed model, an automated system is developed, fully integrated with widely used scheduling software. At each schedule interval, the system recalculates the space requirements and, for the convenience of congested sites, can utilize parts of the constructed space to accommodate temporary facilities. Details of the schedule-dependent model are described, and its application in an actual case study project is presented to demonstrate its capabilities.Keywords: Site layout, quantitative evaluation, material  owIntroductionSite space is a resource that is as important as money, time, material, labour and equipment. Like any resource, the amount of site space demanded by the various activities changes with the schedule of the work. Therefore, during the project the site layout may need to be ef ciently re-organized at various intervals to satisfy the upcoming schedule requirements and to maintain site safety and productivity. Thus, ef cient planning is needed to facilitate the re-organization of the site as the schedule evolves.  Since the early 1970s, several researchers have applied various heuristics or mathematical optimization techniques to solve the static site layout planningproblem in construction (e.g. Warszawski and Peer, 1973; Popescu, 1981; Rodriguez-Ramos, 1982; Rad and James, 1983; Tommelein, 1989). In late 1990s, non-traditional techniques based on arti cial intelligence (AI) were applied to solve the problem (e.g. Yeh, 1995; Dweiri and Meier, 1996; Li and Love, 1998; Elbeltagi and Hegazy, 2000). These models generated static layouts that span the entire project duration.  Models that deal with dynamic layout planning in construction are limited. Cheng (1992) developed a system called ArcSite, a knowledge-based system integrated with a geographic information system (GIS) to locate the temporary facilities on construction sites. In this model, facilities are placed one-by-one on the site and, accordingly, the resulting layout solution is sensitive to the facility order. Also, the one-by-one place-*Author for correspondence. e-mail: tarek@uwaterloo.cament of facilities may not yield the optimal site layoutConstruction Management and EconomicsISSN 0144–6193 print/ISSN 1466-433X online © 2001 Taylor & Francis Ltd http://www.tandf.co.uk/journalsDOI: 10.1080/01446190110066713
plan. In another model, Tommelein and Zouein (1993) developed a dynamic layout planning system that later was expanded in Zouein and Tommelein (1999). Similar to traditional resource allocation, their models tried to modify the schedule at various intervals so that the site space is not overallocated. The latter model used linear programming to dynamically allocate space to resources one-by-one, so that total cost is minimized. Similar to the previous model by Cheng, however, optimum layout may not be obtained. Also, in most of the models presented in the literature, the site and the facilities are rectangular in shape with each facility being represented as a single block. In addition, facilities are assumed to be predetermined, and the models provide few guidelines regarding necessary facilities and their area requirements.  This paper presents a practical model for scheduledependent site layout planning in construction. The proposed model provides direct integration with a scheduling tool to determine the schedule-dependent site needs. Accordingly, it optimizes the site plans needed at various intervals along the construction process. The proposed model is developed using a hybrid of arti cial intelligence tools that provide guidance for facility identi cation, determining facilities’ spatial relationships, and layout optimization. The developments made in this paper add dynamic capabilities to a previous model for static layout planning (Elbeltagi and Hegazy, 2000). Details of the scheduledependent model are described in the following sections and include developments related to: facility identi cation; de nition of the site space needs that vary with the project schedule; and layout optimization. A practical case study is used then to demonstrate the capabilities of the proposed system.Facility identi cationAn integral feature of the proposed model is the support of the project manager’s judgement in identifying the required temporary facilities needed to facilitate construction operations. Since their decisions are based largely on experience, a knowledge-based system was developed to provide support. The knowledge base incorporates 139 ‘IF-THEN’ rules related to 22 temporary facilities (Table 1) and their size requirements (Elbeltagi and Hegazy, 2000). Sources of knowledge include construction safety and health manuals (e.g. ILO, 1992), company handbooks (e.g. Obayashi Corporation, 1975), published dissertations (e.g. Cheng, 1992; Tommelein, 1989), and technical articles (e.g. Popescu, 1981; Rad and James, 1983). The rules determine the size of the facilities based mainly on the manpower requirements, estimated quantity ofTable 1	List of temporary facilitiesNo.Facility nameNo.Facility name(1)(2)(3)(4)1Of ces12Batch plant2First aid13Sampling/ Testing lab3Information and guard14Piping yard4Toilet on site15Parking lot5Engineers/staff dormitory16Tank6Labour’s dormitory17Long term laydown yard7Labour’s rest area18Machine room8Maintenance shop19Shops9Rebar fabrication/20Scaffold storagestorage yardyard10Carpentry shop21Material warehouse11Cement warehouse22Welding shopwork, the production rate of resources, availability of site space, and cost considerations. An example of such a rule is:IFContractor owns, can rent, or can buy a batch plant = trueANDRequired concrete production = highANDSite has enough space for a batch plant = trueANDA batch plant is more economically than ready mix concrete = trueTHENArea of batch plant in m2 = batch plant capacity 3 10Each temporary facility is allocated a site area as determined from the knowledge base, then placed on site as shown in Figure 1. For  exibility, each facility is represented as a number of small grid units that can take irregular shapes. The area of each grid unit is calculated as the greater common divisor (GCD) of the areas of all facilities that need to be placed on any irregular site. A facility is placed on the site grid, starting from its location reference, in three ways (Figure 1), horizontal, vertical, or rectangular, where the location reference is: Location reference =(Facility row position 2 1) 3 Site columns +	Facility column position	(1)For example, facility i (having an area of 5 grid units) is placed horizontally starting at the fourth site row and  rst column (location reference = (4 2 1) 3 11 + 1 = 34). It is noted that facility i is a multi-unit facility that can be placed on site around site obstacles. When facilities are placed on site, distances to other facilities can be measured readily.Figure 1	Site and facilities representationSchedule-dependent site needsAlong the construction schedule, the requirements for site space change, and the layout of temporary facilities needs to be changed. Thus, schedule-dependent site layout planning is the generation of intermediate layouts that respond to the schedule needs at various intervals along the construction schedule.  To facilitate schedule-dependent layout planning, various steps need to be carried out.1. The list of temporary facilities needed for every activity must be identi ed and sized, as discussed in the previous section.2. A detailed schedule of the construction work has to be available. Techniques such as resource leveling and time–cost trade-off analysis can be applied to this schedule so that it becomes as realistic as possible.3. The activities’ requirements of the temporary facilities need to be de ned in a similar way to the requirement of labour, equipment, and other resources. In this sense, the selected temporary facilities are dealt with as resources that can be assigned to activities.4. After step 3 is accomplished, the service times (between facility start time (FST) and facility  nish time (FFT)) of each temporary facility become readable from the schedule.5. Based on step 4, the facilities that serve between any two given dates of the schedule can be de ned and considered as the site needs in this interval.  This process of de ning the site needs is illustrated in Figure 2, in which a list of temporary facilities (of ces, rebar shop, batch plant, and carpentry shop) are considered as resources assigned to some activities. For example, the batch plant is assigned to activities 3 and 10. Accordingly, the service time of the batch plant on the site is between the start date of activity 3 and the  nish date of activity 10. Also, the service times for the four facilities is shown in Figure 2.  Knowing the FST and FFT of each facility, it is possible to decide on the facilities that should be considered for any intermediate layout. Consider a layout j starting from time tj and spanning a layout interval from tj to tj +1 (start of next layout). Thus, for a layout to service the project between times tj and tj +1, a facility i will be considered to be placed on the site if it satisi es the following:(a) tj < FSTi , tj +1(i.e. the facility starts sometime within the	layout interval)	(2)or(b) FSTi , tj and FFTi . tj(i.e. the facility exists on site and is still needed for this layout interval)For example, the batch plant, of ces, and carpentry shop facilities in Figure 2 will be considered for layout 2, which serves the project between times t2 and t3.  One important consideration is to minimize the cost of reallocating facilities so that minimum work disruption is achieved. Therefore, a temporary facility that was placed on the site in a previous layout and is still needed for the new layout will not change its place. Fixing a facility in its place means converting it from a normal facility to a  xed facility. For any layout j, the temporary facilities that need to be converted to  xed facilities are the ones that satisfy condition (b) of Eq. 2. The batch plant facility, for example, was used in layout 1 and will be considered to be a  xed facility in layout 2.Facilities’ change over timeFor increasing construction ef ciency and cost saving, a facility can be placed at the location of another one that is no longer needed at the present schedule time. In that way, the space on site can be used to accommodate different facilities at different times. Now, assuming that three layouts will be suf cient for this simple project (as shown in Figure 2), the rebar shop, for example, will not be needed for layout 2 or 3. In this manner, the space on site can be dynamically re-allocated to accommodate other facilities at different times.Figure 2	Schedule-dependent site layoutConsideration for restricted sitesOn restricted sites, like downtown locations, the management of site space becomes more important than other resources. In many situations, construction managers use part of the constructed facility (e.g. some  oors in a high rise building) for storage purposes or other uses. The present model, therefore, incorporates this important feature in its formulation. For any time interval, the user can select any part of the constructed space to be used for placing a temporary facility. Two conditions must be satis ed in this situation: (1) clearly the constructed space has to be available (i.e. its  nish date is earlier than the service start date of the temporary facility required); and (2) the constructed space area has to be large enough to accommodate the temporary facility.Schedule-dependent layout optimizationHaving de ned the required facilities, their areas, and service times, it is possible to optimize the generation of the various layouts at the user-decided intervals. The optimization process goes through the following steps.1. First identify the layout intervals and the temporary facilities needed for each layout interval, as discussed in the previous section.2. Determine the facilities’ closeness relationships upon which the optimization process will take place.3. Then perform a loop from one interval to the other to optimize the selected list of facilities in each interval.Fuzzy closeness relationshipsEffective placement of facilities within the site improves the movement of resources, or basically the interactions, among the facilities. Such interactions are referred to as the closeness relationships among the facilities, and represent the desirability of having the facilities close to or apart from each other. Due to the vagueness and ambiguity associated with such relationships (e.g. facility A should be ‘as far as possible’ from facility B), especially for large and congested sites, determining crisp values for these relationships is a problem that lends itself well to the fuzzy set approach (Elbeltagi and Hegazy, 2000). Background information on this technique can be found in many references (e.g. Zadeh, 1965; Ross, 1995).  The factors used in this study to determine the closeness weights among facilities are: (1) the level of work  ow (WF) between two facilities; (2) the level of safety/environmental (SE) hazard; and (3) user preference (UP). The work  ow between two facilities encompasses the total  ow of materials, equipment, personnel, and information between the two facilities. The level of safety/environmental hazard also represents any concerns that may arise when the two facilities are close to each other. The third factor, user preference, represents the project manager’s preference for having the facilities close to or apart from each other (Elbeltagi and Hegazy, 2000).  The three factors are used as fuzzy input variables: WF, SE, and UP. These three variables affect the fuzzy output variable ‘closeness weight’. Each input variable is assumed to have three membership functions low (L), medium (M), and high (H), while the output variable has six membership functions (Figure 3). Using the fuzzy rule-based inferencing process described in (Elbeltagi and Hegazy, 2000), a single crisp value for the closeness weight can be calculated between the two facilities based on user input values of WP, SE, and UP. Accordingly, the closeness weights among facilities become an integral part of the site objective function that is described in the following subsection.Layout optimizationThe process of placing temporary facilities on site uses genetic algorithms (GAs) as a non-traditional optimization procedure. Researchers have reported the robustness of GAs and their ability to solve several engineering and construction management problems (e.g. Feng et al., 1997; Li and Love, 1998). Background material on GAs can be found in several references (e.g. Goldberg, 1989). The procedure searches for the optimum location reference of each non- xed facility, so that closeness relationships may be optimally maintained. As shown in Figure 4, the gene structure has been set as a string of elements, each corresponds to the location reference of a non- xed facility, and the gene length equals the number of non xed facilities to be placed on the site. A representative score for the total travel distance associated with a layout is calculated based on the dij distances among the facilities (Figure 1), as follows.	n–1	n	Objective function = iS=l	j=Si+1dijRij	(3)where Rij is the closeness weight value between facilities i and j, and n is the total number of facilities ( xed + non- xed). Equation 3, as such, becomes the objective function to be minimized in the proposed model.Prototype and a case studyFigure 3	Fuzzy sets of the inputs and output variables	Figure 4	Gene formationThe proposed schedule-dependent site layout planning model was implemented on a commercial spreadsheet program to simplify its implementation and automate the system. Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) macros were used to implement all components including the knowledge base, the fuzzy logic, and the GA optimization components in an integrated and automated manner. Also, other macro programs were used to link the layout planning system and a widely used scheduling software (Microsoft Project 1998), thus establishing a direct link to the project schedule. After implementation, testing was carried out on various hypothetical examples. Afterwards, the system was tried with actual case study projects to verify its wide applicability. A challenging case study is presented in the following section to demonstrate the system capabilities.Project challengesThe case study deals with a project constructed in Mansoura, Egypt, involving: (1) a two-storey community centre (the main building); (2) a gymnasium; (3) a cafeteria; (4) a service building; (5) two swimming pools; and (6) power-room/fence/two-gates with attached utilities. The construction site area is 18 700 m2 (170 m 3 110 m). Figure 5 shows the general site plan with a layout of the buildings to be constructed.  At the time of applying the prototype to this project (autumn of 1999), construction was about 50% complete. The project at that time was experiencing some dif culties related mainly to lack of productivity, a disorganized site, and material handling problems. Originally no formal site layout plan was made for the site, and the consultant depended mainly on the general contractor’s experience in organizing the site. The abundant site space gave the consultant and the contractor a mistaken impression that the site is spacious and that there was no need to spend time or money on planning the temporary facilities. The buildings to be constructed were scattered in various locations within the site, and the contractor formed material storage areas around each building perceivably to satisfy their individual needs. However, this resulted in excessive material waste, extra material handling costs, and less maneuvrability within the site. The main activities affected were the foundation piles in the main building and the swimming pools, since piling activities needed extra space for the piles, steel cages, and the piling equipment. Problems were also experienced related to crew movements and safety conditions.  After discussing such problems with the consultant and the contractor, it was decided to experiment with the prototype to investigate three aspects, which will be discussed in the next section:1. the ability of the prototype to divide the site andthe facilities into small grid units that can take irregular shapes;2. the ability of the prototype to generate an initial layout that could have circumvented some of the experienced problems along the schedule development; and3. the usability of the prototype to generate a modi ed layout in account of the actual work done on site.Layout optimizationBased on the project information obtained from the consultant and the contractor, the prototype was used to generate an initial site layout plan. First, the necessary temporary facilities and their areas were identi ed through the knowledge-based module, and were con rmed by the consultant. Accordingly, the site unit area was calculated as 25 m2, which represents the GCD of all facilities’ areas.  A detailed schedule of the activities involved in the project was obtained. The schedule involves 121 activities, grouped by building types, as shown in Figure 6. After de ning the temporary facilities, the prototype automatically activated the schedule to assign the identi ed temporary facilities to the various activities, using the software features. Once this was done, a list of the temporary facilities and their expected service times on the project became available, as shown in Figure 7.  The next step was to map the irregular site shape on the prototype. Given a grid unit area of 25 m2, the site was represented by spreadsheet cells, each cell representing one grid unit. Using coloured cells, the site was drawn on the spreadsheet as in Figure 8, showing the  xed locations of the buildings that will be constructed on the site, the access roads, and the site gates. The irregular shapes demonstrate the  exibility of the prototype to model any site and facilities.
Figure 5	Case study project
  Knowing the service time for each temporary facility, the choice was made of having three layout intervals, each covering one third of the construction period, as shown in Figure 6. Accordingly, the prototype automatically provided a list of the facilities that will be used in each layout interval (using Eq. 2). The facilities needed for the  rst layout are shown in Figure 9.	Figure 6	Case study project schedulingFigure 7	Final list of facilities  Before starting with the  rst layout, the facilities’ closeness weights were determined using the fuzzy logic module. Between each pair of facilities, numeric values of the work  ow, safety concerns, and user preference were entered. Accordingly, the prototype automatically calculated a crisp value for the closeness weight between the two facilities. Note that, due to theFigure 8	Site representation with  xed facilities preset
Figure 9	List of facilities for the  rst layout interval
predetermined positions of the  xed facilities, the closeness weights among them are zeros.  Having the facilities for each layout interval de ned and their relationships determined, the optimization process started using GAs. Accordingly, the prototype came up with the optimum site layout for the  rst layout interval shown in Figure 10, given a minimum representative score of 48 855 348.  In the second scheduling period, facilities that ended in the previous interval were not considered for this interval and their site areas were used to accommodate other facilities. Also, the facilities laid out in the pervious interval and still needed for this interval were considered as  xed facilities. The full list of facilities for this layout interval is shown in Figure 11. For this interval, the main building had been completed and it could be used to accommodate temporary facilities, namely the piping yard and the carpentry shop, as its area can accommodate the two facilities (shown in Figures 10 and 12). The  nal optimum solution for this interval is that in Figure 12.  The optimum layout for the third interval was obtained similarly. Then the results of the site layout planning for the three intervals were shown to the consultant and the contractor, and favourable comments were received. The  exibility of the system was a major point of appeal. While processing time was longer than expected, particularly for the  rst site layout (2 hours on a Pentium 450 MHz personal computer), the system was able to determine layout plans that experts agreed with and did not wish to modify.  The second experiment conducted with the prototype was to try improving an existing site layout or optimally to place a new facility in a given layout. However, this is merely a special and much simplerFigure 11	List of facilities for the second layout intervalFigure 10 Optimum solution of the  rst layout interval Figure 12 Optimum layout with part of the constructed space accommodating temporary facilitiescase application. Only the storage space was to be relocated, while keeping all other facilities  xed in place. Accordingly, the prototype was used to model all the facilities other than the storage space as  xed facilities on the site map. The optimization was then conducted having only one temporary facility to optimally reallocate the storage space. This type of use is important when a crane is being located on the site.  The schedule-dependent approach for site planning presented in this paper is simple and practical, yet it can be expanded to consider the actual pro le of material use within the construction activities. Also it can be linked to a geographic information system to automate the mapping of the site and the identi cation of site characteristics.Summary and conclusionsA practical system has been presented for evolving a site layout plan as the project schedule progresses. The proposed model encompasses: (1)  exible representation of the site, facilities, and placement options; (2) a large knowledge-base for facility identi cation and area determination; (3) fuzzy-logic assessment of the vagueness in the facilities’ inter-relationships; (4) a genetic algorithm search for an optimal layout solution; and (5) direct integration with a scheduling tool to determine the schedule-dependent site needs. The current layout methodology improves the site planning ef ciency by the integration of the entire site layout planning tasks into a single environment. This capability not only speeds up the planning process but also ensures data integrity and accuracy. In addition, the integration of the schedule and layout information makes it easy for the project manager to track and update the layout of the site. Two important features were considered in the developed model that might help project managers in laying out restricted site space: (i) the use of the constructed space to place a temporary facility; and (ii) the use of the site space to accommodate different facilities at different times. A practical case study project has demonstrated the capabilities of the proposed system.ReferencesCheng, M. Y.
