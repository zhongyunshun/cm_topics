Construction Management and Economics (2000) 18, 15± 27	Trends in productivity improvement in the US construction industryDAVID ARDITI and KRISHNA MOCHTARIllinois Institute of Technology, Department of Civil and Architectural Engineering, Chicago, IL 60616± 3793, USAReceived 30 March 1998; accepted 28 January 1999Surveys of the top 400 US contractors were conducted in 1979, 1983 and 1993 to identify the areas with potential for productivity improvement in the construction industry. The trends in the ® ndings of these surveys are observed and interpreted. The results indicate that cost control, scheduling, design practices, labour training, and quality control are the functions that consistently over the years are perceived as having considerable room for productivity improvement, whereas materials packaging and foreign developments in construction technologies are perceived consistently as functions that do not have much effect on improving construction productivity. The functions that were identi® ed as needing more improvement in 1993 compared with the previous surveys were prefabrication, new materials, value engineering, speci® cations, labour availability, labour training, and quality control, whereas those that were identi® ed as needing less improvement than in the previous surveys were ® eld inspection and labour contract agreements. Also, respondents indicated consistently over the years that they are willing to participate in activities related to improving construction productivity but are not interested in funding any such activities.Keywords: Construction productivity, construction industry, productivity trends, USA  
IntroductionThere are three productivity measurements used commonly in industry (Oglesby, 1988). First there is an economic model that de® nes productivity as total factor productivity (TFP), that is the ratio between total outputs expressed in dollars and total inputs expressed in dollars as well. The total inputs include labour, materials, equipment, energy, and capital. This de® nition is used by policy-maker agencies to make policy and evaluate the state of the economy of the ® country. The second is the project-speci® c model that de® nes productivity as total productivity (TP), that is the ratio between the outputs expressed in a physical unit (for example square feet) and the inputs expressed in dollars. The inputs include labour, equipment, materials, and management. This model is more accurate, and it can be used by both governmental agencies and by the private sector. Third is the activity-oriented model that de® nes productivity as labour productivity, that is the ratio between outputs expressed in speci® c physical units (for example tons of steel) and inputs expressed in man-hours. The inputs include labour only. This model is useful for producers in calculating the project cost and monitoring ® eld activity.  Productivity in the construction industry is in¯ uenced not only by labour, but also by other factors such as equipment, materials, construction methods, and site management. While labour productivity is useful for contractors in bidding and monitoring eld activities, total productivity is used by governmental agencies for speci® c programme planning and by the private sector for conceptual cost and time estimating on individual construction projects. The term `productivity’ is used in this paper synonymously with total productivity where inputs include labour, materials, equipment, construction methods, and site management.Construction Management and EconomicsISSN 0144± 6193 print/ISSN 1466-433X online  2000 Taylor & Francis Ltd  The output of the construction industry constitutes one-half of the gross capital and is 3± 8% of the gross domestic product (GDP) in most countries. Therefore productivity improvement in the construction industry may have a signi® cant impact on improving GDP. In the USA, construction is the nation’s largest industry sector in terms of yearly dollar volume. However, construction productivity has been on the decline since the 1980s and frequently construction labour ef® ciency is cited as poor (Adrian, 1987). One of two startling conclusions in the Construction Industry Cost Effectiveness (CICE) project is that construction productivity in the 1980s has either increased at a lower rate than other industries or actually declined. As a consequence, the cost of construction has increased by 50% over the in¯ ation rate in the same period (Oglesby, 1988).  The objective of the study reported in this paper is to analyse statistically the ® ndings of the surveys administered to contracting companies that identi® ed the possible areas for productivity improvement in the construction industry in 1979 by Choromokos and McKee (1981), in 1983 by Nasra (1983), and in 1993 by Mochtar (1994). An interpretation of the perceived trends in the period 1979± 1993 is reported in this paper. The results provide some insights into the actions that should be taken in the context of improving productivity in the construction industry.MethodologyNasra (1983) conducted a survey of the top 400 US construction contractors in 1983 to identify the potential areas of productivity improvement in the US construction industry. He sent out questionnaires to the top executives of the top 400 contractors. The survey data were analysed by Arditi (1985). The survey questionnaire was an exact duplication of the 1979 survey conducted by Choromokos and McKee (1981). The duplication of the 1979 survey was justi® ed in 1983 by the consideration that economic conditions and the construction climate had changed signi® cantly from 1979 to 1983 and that the trends and correlations needed to be observed again. Based on the same consideration, the questionnaire used in the 1979 and 1983 surveys was slightly modi® ed and sent out in 1993 to the then current top 400 US construction contractors (ENR the top 400 contractors, 1992). A copy of the questionnaire used in the 1993 survey is presented in the Appendix. Data related to the three categories of `contracting’, `computer utilization’, and `labour productivity improvement techniques’ are not analysed in this paper because these three categories were not part of the 1979 and 1983 survey questionnaires, making a comparison impossible.  The objective of the questionnaire was to obtain three main types of information. First, general characteristics of construction companies were sought. These include the type of work the organization undertakes, annual sales, number of permanent and temporary employees, amount of equipment owned and leased, amount of work subcontracted, and geographical location of projects. Second, respondents were asked to indicate the most fertile areas for productivity improvement. In the 1979 and 1983 surveys, these areas were divided into seven categories, namely management, materials, engineering, construction techniques, regulations, labour, and equipment. Each category comprises a set of functions that can be seen in the questionnaire presented in the Appendix. Finally, the types of action that the responding organizations would be willing to take in the interest of improving productivity were investigated.  A respondent could rate the potential for productivity improvement in each function as `high’, `medium’, or `low’. A high rating indicates that there is considerable room for improvement in a particular function, whereas a low rating indicates that a function is performed quite ef® ciently. The scoring system is set as 3, 2, and 1 points for high, medium, and low ratings, respectively. The mean score(s) for each function is calculated by means of the following equation:3h + 2m + lS = Ð Ð Ð Ð Ð Ð 	(1) h + m + lwhere S is the mean score, h is the percentage of respondents that gave a `high’ rating to the function, m is the percentage of respondents that gave a `medium’ rating to the function, and l is the percentage of respondents that gave a `low’ rating to the function.  A signi® cance test of the difference between the mean scores obtained in each survey is conducted for each function by means of Duncan’s multiple-range test. The value of the least signi® cant range (Rp) is calculated by the following equation:	Rp = rp ! Ð S2Ð [ÐN1Ð +Ð NÐ 2]± 	(2)               2 N1 N2 where rp is the least signi® cant studentized range, S2 is the variance of overall data, N1 is the number of respondents in the ® rst set of data, and N2 is the number of respondents in the second set of data.  The values of rp depend on the desired level of significance (taken as 0.05 in this analysis), the number of degrees of freedom of the overall data, and the number of subset (p = 2 or 3 in this study) sample means. The number f of degrees of freedom of the overall data is calculated by the following equation:  f = (N79 ± 1) + (N83 ± 1) + (N93 ± 1) (3) where N79 is the number of respondents in the 1979 survey, N83 is the number of respondents in the 1983 survey, and N93 is the number of respondents in the 1993 survey.  If the difference between the mean scores is less than Rp, then the difference is not signi® cant and vice versa.Comparison of survey ® ndingsOut of the 400 questionnaires mailed to the top 400 US contractors, 139 (or 35%) were returned in the 1993 survey, compared with 15% in the 1983 survey and 20% in the 1979 survey. The relatively low returns in the 1979 and 1983 surveys should not affect the research ® ndings since a similar approach was used in all three surveys.  Table 1 presents the data regarding responding contractors’ company characteristics in the 1979, 1983 and 1993 surveys. It indicates that: 1. over 60% of the responding contractors performed one type of construction; 2. over 60% had annual sales ranging from $50 million to $500 million; 3. over 55% employed 100± 500 permanent employees and over 50% hired fewer than 500 temporary employees; 4. about half of the companies owned less than $5 million worth of heavy equipment and leased or rented less than 25% of their equipment; 5. about half of the companies subcontracted less than 50% of the total dollar value on an average construction project; and 6. all the companies performed projects almost exclusively in the continental USA. In this question, the responses do not add up to 100% because most companies operate in more than one geographical area.  The trends between the 1979, 1983, and 1993 ® ndings are consistently similar in all except the subcontracting function. The number of respondents that subcontracted less than 50% of the work showed a marked decrease in 1993 (40%) as opposed to 1979 and 1983 (58% and 59% respectively), whereas the number of contractors that subcontracted 75± 100% of the work doubled (from 18% in 1983 to 36% in 1993). It appears that in the 1990s more contractors provided only construction supervision, job coordination and perhaps basic site services. The consistent similarity in most other categories indicates that the contracting companies’ strategy in business, marketing, and investment did not change considerably between the years 1979 and 1993.  The contractors who took part in the 1979 survey probably were not the same contractors who took part in the 1983 survey, and the contractors who took part in the 1983 survey were probably not the same contractors who took part in the 1993 survey. There are two reasons for this situation. First, the researchers have no control over which of the 400 contractors return the questionnaires; second, the composition of the top 400 contractors changes from year to year with some companies falling out of the list and new companies getting in. A comparison of the perceptions of different populations may, at ® rst sight, appear to be ¯ awed, but given the similarities of the respondents’ primary characteristics mentioned in the preceding paragraphs, it should be quite safe to make such a comparison.  The mean scores of perceived productivity improvement in the 1979, 1983 and 1993 surveys and the trends between them are presented in Table 2, where mean scores between 1 and 1.66 are classi® ed as having low potential for improvement, 1.67 to 2.33 as having medium potential for improvement, and 2.34 to 3.00 as having high potential for improvement; these are denoted by L, M, and H, respectively, and the statistical signi® cance of the differences are indicated by a superscript `c’ that denotes a statistically signi® cant change between the 1979 and 1993 surveys at a level of 5%, and a superscript `d’ that denotes a signi® cant change at 5% between the 1983 and the 1993 surveys. Given the relatively short period of time between the 1979 and 1983 surveys, it is not surprising that there are no statistically signi® cant changes between the ® ndings of these two surveys. Note that because the overall degree of freedom f (Equation 3) for all cases is greater than 120, rp = 2.77 for p = 2 and rp = 2.97 for p = 3. However, because the number of responses N1 and N2 (Equation 2) to each question was different in the different surveys, different Rp values for every item on the questionnaire are calculated in each of the three comparisons 1979± 1983, 1979± 1993, and 1983± 1993. To avoid cluttering, Table 2 shows only the results in terms of `c’ and `d’ superscripts that indicate signi® cant differences.  The functions that have been identi® ed consistently as having high potential for improvement (H in at least two of the three surveys), those that have consistently been identi® ed as having low potential for improvement (L in at least two of the three surveys), and the functions that exhibit a statistically signi® cant change over the years (marked with the superscript `a’ or `b’) are discussed in more detail in the following section. The last column of Table 2 presents the averages of the mean scores obtained in all three surveys. These averages are used as a complement to the preceding column on trends to identify functions that are considered to have high potential for improvement. Some of the categories are combined in the following subsections for ease of discussion.Materials and managementAs observed in Table 2, two functions, namely materials packaging (L-L-L) in the `materials’ category and cost control (H-M-H) in the `management’ Table 1	Company characteristics of responding contractorsCompany characteristicsPercent of respondents1979 Survey1983 Survey1993 SurveyType of project Three types151512Two types201820One type626568Other construction320Annual sales ($ million) 10± 5030201250± 100403637100± 500203840>50010611Number of permanent employees <100152221100± 500556258500± 5000171318>5000332Number of temporary employees <100182033100± 500334737500± 10002618171000± 50001385>50001073Dollar value of construction equipment ($ million)<55252485± 2528282625± 501581050± 2003109>200327Percentage of construction equipment leased or rented 0111615<2544444425± 5022121750± 75813775± 100151516Percentage of work subcontracted on average job <2531281825± 5027312250± 7531232575± 100111836Geographic location of projects Northeastern states362844Mid-Atlantic states153046Southern states115146Southwestern states104440Central states53432Western and northwestern states45139Outside continental USA15157category have received consistently low (L) and high (H) scores, respectively, whereas the remaining functions received mostly neutral (M) responses.  The consistent perception that there is a `low’ opportunity for productivity improvement in materials packaging might indicate that respondents have already enjoyed good packaging systems or that packaging for materials delivery to the construction site is not a problem. By rating materials packaging `low’, contractors may think that materials packaging is the responsibility of materials manufacturers rather than contractors.  Competitive bid gives the owner the advantage of competitive pricing and also forces contractors to lookTable 2	Potential for productivity improvement in construction functions as perceived by contractors FunctionsMaterialsProcurement1.911.882.11M-M-M1.97Delivery2.192.072.17M-M-M2.14Storage1.771.861.65M-M-L1.76Packaging1.531.651.55L-L-L1.58Prefabrication1.922.192.31cM-M-M2.14Standardization2.322.262.35M-M-H2.31Product availability2.121.972.00M-M-M2.03  New products Management2.012.002.22cM-M-M2.08Estimating2.082.222.10M-M-M2.13Cost control2.402.262.35H-M-H2.34Scheduling2.332.282.37M-M-H2.33Field inspection2.422.311.92c,dH-M-M2.22Marketing1.932.091.95M-M-M1.99  Communications Engineering2.202.352.28M-H-M2.28Design standards2.182.252.12M-M-M2.18Design practices2.392.462.41H-H-H2.42Systems engineering2.152.182.17M-M-M2.17Drafting1.751.721.75M-M-M1.74Speci® cations1.891.802.12c,dM-M-M1.94  Value engineering Construction techniques1.962.112.24cM-M-M2.10Precast elements2.042.162.14M-M-M2.11Preassembled modulars2.052.232.19M-M-M2.16  Foreign developments Labour1.561.731.69L-M-M1.66Turnover2.012.162.19M-M-M2.12Availability2.111.902.13dM-M-M2.05Labour relations2.122.172.12M-M-M2.14Contract agreement2.242.341.94c,dM-H-M2.17Training2.372.522.63cH-H-H2.51  Quality control Regulations2.172.432.56cM-H-H2.39EPA2.161.882.04M-M-M2.03OSHA2.282.072.15M-M-M2.17EEO2.261.982.01M-M-M2.08  Local codes Equipment2.022.061.90M-M-M1.99Capacity1.711.861.89M-M-M1.82Simplicity1.972.041.94M-M-M1.98Maintainability2.132.222.06M-M-M2.14Utilization2.122.322.16M-M-M2.20a Status presented in chronological order; 1979, 1983 and 1993 surveys. b L = low opportunity for improvement, range 1.00± 1.66; M = medium opportunity for improvement, range 1.67± 2.33; H = high opportunityfor improvement, range 2.34± 3.00. c Change between 1979 and 1993 signi® cant at 5%. d Change between 1983 and 1993 signi® cant at 5%.for every advantage during construction to control cost and maintain a pro® table stance (Arditi and Gunaydin, 1997). Cost control activities include the preparation of a cost plan, the collection of actual cost data, the reporting of cost deviations, and ® nally the decision and actions to correct variations within acceptable limits (Halpin, 1985). According to Paulson (1995), no cost control system is of any value without accurate, timely input data, so that the use of computers and appropriate software packages are necessary especially in projects of high complexity. The ® nding that responding contractors perceive the cost control function as having `high’ potential for improvement indicates that they encounter problems in implementing the cost control activities mentioned above; using more ef® cient cost planning methods, such as more sophisticated computerized systems as suggested by Paulson (1995), could improve their overall productivity.  The differences in the mean scores in the 1979, 1983 and 1993 surveys are statistically signi® cant in three functions, namely materials prefabrication and new products in the `materials’ category, and ® eld inspection in the `management’ category.  In the `materials’ category, there were signi® cant upward trends from 1979 to 1993 in material prefabrication (from 1.92 to 2.31) and the new products functions (from 2.01 to 2.22). Cohenca et al. (1989) conclude in their research performed in conjunction with the Business Roundtable’s Construction Industry Cost-Effectiveness Project that on-site construction activities for industrial projects are perceived to be the most troubling quality and productivity problem. The troublesome items were identi® ed as concrete, piping, welding, roo® ng, painting and electrical work. In order to improve productivity in the construction industry, designers could minimize construction activities on-site by increasing the use of prefabricated and precast components. In this way, it becomes easier to manage the issues of quality and project control.  The new products function in the `materials’ category appears to be perceived as needing more improvement in 1993 than in 1979. It is indeed true that, due to the rapid developments in materials science, the number of new products that go into the market is increasing. For example, the use of accelerating admixtures in concrete production is known to have increased site productivity (Jolin et al., 1997) and has allowed the adoption of construction techniques that were not an option before the advent of these materials. Another example is the use of ® bre-reinforced polymer composite wraps in rehabilitation projects, which has been proved to increase durability and constructability (Toutanji and Balaguru, 1998). On the other hand, usually the price of new products is relatively higher than that of conventional products. The signi® cant upward trend in the function new products might indicate that although respondents are aware of the very many new products that are available in the market and of their potentially positive effects on site productivity, more effort is called for in order to make these materials more cost-effective.  Still in the `materials’ category, although the change is not statistically signi® cant, it is interesting to note the downward trend in the materials storage function from a `medium’ rating of 1.86 in the 1983 survey to a `low’ rating of 1.65 in the 1993 survey. It is possible that the development of new materials, coupled with sophisticated and computerized stock control and order tracking systems, help to alleviate storage problems in construction sites.  Again in the `materials’ category, even though the change is not statistically signi® cant, there seems to be an upward trend in the material standardization function in the last decade (from 2.26 in 1983 to 2.35 in 1993). There are many material standards that are speci® ed by the Federal Government, state departments of transportation, and a variety of technical societies such as the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM), the American National Standards Institute (ANSI), and the American Institute of Steel Construction (AISC). These standards have been devised by specialists in their ® elds and are well accepted by the industry (Clough, 1986). With the increasing architectural and structural complexity of construction in the 1980s and 1990s, it appears that material standardization has become more effective than before in improving productivity. This ® nding is supported further by the signi® cant upward trend in the speci® cations function (in the `engineering’ category). It seems that contractors encounter problems in interpreting speci® cations, especially regarding materials, so that more stringent material standardization is recommended.  There is a signi® cant downward trend in the ® eld inspection function from a `high’ rating of 2.42 in 1979 to a `medium’ rating of 1.92 in 1993. It seems that ® eld inspection techniques have improved since the 1979 survey. Sweetapple (1985) stated that it is a good practice for the contractor and the engineer to gather regularly to discuss and record clearly the matters requiring attention by one party or the other. The contractor’s work should be inspected on a regular basis. If the contractors know that they are accountable for their work efforts, they are likely to be more attentive to the performance of their work and hence be more productive. Also, construction owners should know that their agent’s timely, regular and consistent inspections will increase a contractor’s productivity. Considering the amount of published information regarding quality assurance and quality control in the recent literature (e.g., Ashford, 1989; Deffenbaugh, 1993; Evans and Lindsay, 1993) and the development and adaptation of work site recording software such as Expedition, a case can be made that ® eld supervision problems have been resolved to a certain extent.  Even though it is not statistically signi® cant, it is observed in the `management’ category that pressures to increase productivity in the scheduling function have increased (the mean ratings went up from `medium’ to `high’) in the last decade. Schedule control is considered to be one of the most signi® cant management functions in the construction process (Rasdorf and Abudayyeh, 1991). It aims at the regular monitoring of achievement by comparing against planned activities, and it is a continuous process throughout the life of the project. Different scheduling techniques are available such as Gantt charts, CPM networks, line-of-balance schedules, progress curves, etc. In order to ensure the ef® cient performance of the contractor in the construction phase, the project owner should include contract clauses forcing the contractor to manage itself, such as clauses requiring weekly or monthly schedule updates, good ® eld reporting and accounting practices, and short-interval scheduling. CPM scheduling which in® ltrated into the construction industry in the late 1960s has been on the rise since then. One of the reasons why respondents feel that the scheduling function needs improvement more than ever lies in the fact that CPM networks are being used indiscriminately on each and every project with sometimes disastrous consequences; for example, it does not make sense to use standard CPM schedules on projects where activities are repetitive. Another reason why scheduling practices in the 1990s are perceived as needing improvement is because projects have become larger in size, more complex and more demanding, whereas not too much attention has been paid to problems in CPM implementation, such as impacts on organizational structure, corporate culture, human interactions, communication patterns, distribution of responsibilities, and legal liabilities. Although existing scheduling techniques should be effective they are not always so because they are not implemented properly. Further improving the scheduling function can be achieved by solving the inherent problems during its implementation.Engineering and construction techniquesThe only function in the `engineering’ and `construction’ categories that received consistently high (H) scores is design practices (H-H-H). There are two functions where the differences in the mean scores in the 1979, 1983 and 1993 surveys were statistically signi® cant, namely, speci® cations and value engineering. No function received consistently low (L) scores. The remaining functions received neutral (M) scores.  Improvements in design practices can be achieved through constructability reviews. For example, Fisher and O’Connor (1991) concentrated on three major areas in semi-automated piping construction to review constructability issues: material handling, equipment capabilities, and equipment con® guration. They found that construction productivity was improved by 24% when constructability issues were reviewed in the design process. Design reviews to improve the technical quality and constructability of drawings and speci® cations can result in signi® cant savings in project cost, contract modi® cations and subsequent liability claims (Kirby et al., 1988). The establishment of a formal design review programme conducted by quali® ed professionals is one of the most effective means of identifying de® ciencies and incorporating improvements into the contract documents. The ® nding that respondents consistently assigned the design practices function high scores in the 1979, 1983 and 1993 surveys indicates that, with the increasing complexity of construction projects, contractors are experiencing greater productivity problems because of design errors and deviations. This ® nding is supported by the research ® ndings obtained by Burati et al. (1992) that the quality deviations in construction projects accounted for an average of 12.4% of the total project costs; design deviations averaged 78% of the total number of deviations and 79% of the total deviation costs. In turn, design errors result in contract claims. These claims reduce overall productivity considerably because the contracting parties waste energy, time and money settling the disagreements. Moreover, the relationship between the parties becomes adversarial and this affects overall productivity negatively (Fondahl, 1991).  One of the ® nal products of the design work is speci® cations. This is one of the most important contract documents because the contractors build the project based on the information contained in the speci® cations. The quality of the constructed project is highly dependent on the clarity and completeness of the speci® cations (Arditi and Gunaydin, 1997). Even though some designers use standard speci® cations such as the one provided by the Construction Speci® cations Institute (CSI), the ® nding that the speci® cations function shows an upward trend that is statistically signi® cant from the 1979 and 1983 to the 1993 surveys indicates the increasing frustration on the part of responding contractors with the speci® cations prepared by designers. For example, construction methods are described clearly and in much detail in some project speci® cations, whereas they are described in general terms only in others. The clarity, consistency, language, level of detail and precision of the speci® cations not only may make life easier for the contractors but also may minimize the number of interpretation-based disagreements between contractors and designers.  Value engineering has been applied traditionally in the design phase, because recommended changes can be evaluated easily in this phase by comparing the difference in quantities and costs of materials as well as labour and materials required to construct the project. Thus value engineering has its greatest impact during the design phase (Zimmermann and Hart, 1982). In projects where the prospective contractor is known in the design phase, inputs from the contractor are valuable for designers in value engineering their design. In such cases, the designers and the contractor can discuss the most appropriate design and construction methods for the project. In turn, the contractor can build the project in the most ef® cient way (Mochtar, 1994). Although not speci® cally recommended in the literature, value engineering could also be applied in the construction phase. The ® ndings of a survey of construction management ® rms in the US show that value engineering is applied in the pre-bid phases, namely in the design, planning and conceptual phases rather than in the construction phase, (Arditi and Alifen, 1996). The ® nding that respondents assigned the value engineering function signi® cantly higher scores in the 1993 survey compared with the 1979 survey indicates that they have increasing problems with design documents. It is indeed possible to conclude that the value of the projects they undertake is regarded as not optimal. This ® nding agrees with the consistently high scores in design practices in the `engineering’ category discussed previously.Labour, regulations, and equipmentThe only functions in the `labour’, `regulations’, and `equipment’ categories that received consistently high (H) scores are labour training (H-H-H) and quality control (M-H-H). No function received consistently low (L) scores. The remaining functions received neutral (M) scores. There are four functions where the differences of the mean scores are statistically signi® cant, namely labour availability, contract agreements, labour training, and quality control, all of them being in the `labour’ category.  The training of labour appears to be the function that needs the greatest improvement, since it received consistently high scores (H-H-H) and the highest mean score (2.51) in the surveys. The decline of union membership and union shop contractors causes a decline in the traditional union training and apprenticeship programmes. The shift to open-shop construction inevitably makes contractors rely on a workforce that may or may not have been trained properly in their respective trades.  A signi® cant upward trend in the quality control function is observed from a medium (M) rating of 2.17 in 1979 to a high (H) rating of 2.43 in 1983 and to a higher H rating of 2.56 in 1993. This ® nding ties in with the previously discussed trends that proper training of labour is being neglected and that properly trained labour is becoming scarce; inevitably these conditions lead to a crisis in the quality of the work performed. Quality can be de® ned as meeting the legal, aesthetic and functional requirements of a project (Arditi and Gunaydin, 1997). Quality control is the speci® c implementation of the quality assurance programme covering activities necessary to provide quality in the work, including labour quality, to meet the project requirements. One way in which more attention will be given to quality control is the development of a project quality control plan. The quality control function involves the various techniques and activities used to monitor the process and to pursue the elimination of sources that lead to unsatisfactory quality performance, such as the quality of labour workmanship. These concepts are integrated parts of total quality management (TQM), which has been applied to a certain extent in the construction industry since the 1970s (Arditi and Gunaydin, 1997). The ® nding that the quality control function in the `labour’ category received a signi® cant upward trend from 1979 to 1993 indicates that respondents are more cognizant of quality-related issues nowadays because of the heavy emphasis being put on quality by construction owners.  In the `labour’ category, the contract agreements function follows a signi® cant downward trend from a medium (M) rating of 2.24 in 1979 and a high (H) rating of 2.34 in 1983 to a medium (M) rating of 1.94 in 1993. According to Abbasi (1993), open-shop construction started recovering its share in the industry in the early 1970s and expanded rapidly during the last two decades, leading to a decline in union membership. The signi® cant decline on the importance perceived by contractors as to the content and improvement of labour agreements may be attributed to the decline in the bargaining power of unions in this period.  Again in the `labour’ category, it seems that it was more dif® cult to employ quali® ed labour in 1993 than in 1979 and 1983. According to Ashford (1989), many buildings and structures have failed to satisfy the legitimate requirements in recent years because they were built by semi-skilled labour. Once the contractor uses unquali® ed labour in construction, ® eld productivity suffers due to substandard works and frequent rework. This ® nding agrees with the signi® cant upward trends in labour training (from 2.37 in 1979 to 2.63 in 1993) and labour availability (from 1.90 in 1983 to 2.13 in 1993).Proposed actions to improve productivityTable 3 presents the responding companies’ attitudes towards participating in productivity improvement programmes. It is seen that over 31% of the companies would assist with the programmes in some ways. Contributing funds to support the programmes is the least popular action. It appears that althoughTable 3	Contractors’ willingness to participate in improving productivityPercent of respondentsActions to improve productivity	1979 Survey 1983 Survey 1993 SurveyServe as a member of a group that identi® es productivity problems	433945Contribute funds to support programmes aimed at improving construction productivity 261819Develop project aimed at improving construction productivity	262631Conduct projects aimed at improving construction productivity	403838Evaluate results of projects aimed at improving construction productivity	545451Attend conference and meeting on construction productivity	554949Subscribe to a construction productivity information service	413634companies surveyed are eager to attend meetings, identify productivity-related problems, and evaluate solutions, they are not interested in spending money for these activities, nor in initiating or conducting such activities. Given the absence of such interest on the part of contractors, it is recommended that professional organizations, trade associations, educational institutions and governmental agencies ® ll the gap by providing training programmes and by funding research activities to spearhead productivity awareness. The ® ndings of the 1979, 1983 and 1993 surveys are quite similar to each other with no statistically significant differences.ConclusionsLarge US construction companies were surveyed in 1993 by Mochtar (1994), in 1983 by Nasra (1983), and in 1979 by Choromokos and McKee (1981) to identify areas that are perceived as having potential for productivity improvement. The rates of return of all the surveys (35% in 1993, 15% in 1983, and 20% in 1979) were relatively high. One of the reasons for these high rates of return may be that contractors were interested in looking for ways to increase their productivity and consequently position themselves favourably in the highly competitive markets of the 1980s and 1990s.  There are four functions, namely cost control (HM-H), value engineering (H-H-H), labour training (H-H-H), and quality control (M-H-H) that have been identi® ed consistently by the respondents in all three surveys as having considerable room for improvement. It appears that completing a project within budget, cutting costs without impinging on quality or function, having access to competent labour, and maximizing quality in the constructed facility are the functions whose impacts on total productivity did not change over time. Improving the effectiveness of cost control methods, establishing value engineering as a regular practice in all phases of a project, putting in place the mechanisms that will allow the proper training of the labour force, and instituting formal quality control processes such as total quality management (TQM), may constitute essential steps towards improving total productivity in a construction project.  Another function, scheduling (M-M-H), received the fourth highest mean scores in the three surveys (2.33), indicating that it should be considered, along with cost control, value engineering, labour training, and quality control, as an area where considerable improvement is due. Sophisticated scheduling methods and advanced scheduling software have always been available but they are often not properly and extensively used. Research into developing ways to effectively implement existing scheduling and progress control technologies is long overdue.  Only one function, namely materials packaging (LL-L) has been identi® ed consistently as not requiring any improvement, possibly because packaging of construction materials is not a big problem and because it is not an activity that is within the contractors’ purview. Foreign developments (L-M-M), a function in the `construction techniques’ category, received the second lowest mean score in the three surveys (1.66), indicating that typically US contractors do not rely on foreign construction technologies and therefore foreign technologies have no impact on their productivity.  There are nine functions that were rated differently in the 1979, 1983 and 1993 surveys administered to contractors. These differences were statistically signi® cant. These functions include ® eld inspection, material prefabrication, new products, speci® cations, value engineering, labour contract agreements, labour training, quality control, and labour availability. It appears that the increasing complexity of construction projects caused the respondents to seek more ef® cient speci® cations and design practices, as well as to explore greater use of new products and prefabricated components. The impact of the decline of union membership in the construction industry is also apparent in the ® ndings; while labour agreements do not carry the same importance in the 1993 survey, quality of work, training and availability of workers have emerged as new areas of concern. More research in these speci® c areas is recommended in the future.  It is concluded from the survey results that generally the responding contractors are not interested in contributing funds to support productivity improvement programmes. On the other hand, they are more willing to participate in and contribute to productivity improvement groups and projects. There was no marked change between the 1979, 1983 and 1993 surveys in the contractors’ opinions as to the proposed actions for increasing productivity.  It is recommended that new surveys be conducted periodically to observe and identify the new trends in the construction industry and to steer research in the appropriate direction. Both the effective coordination of such research and the fast communication of the results among all parties in the construction industry, especially designers, construction managers and contractors, are necessary.ReferencesAbbasi, M.F.
