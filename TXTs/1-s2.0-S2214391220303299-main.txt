The Long-Term Pavement Performance (LTPP) database does not include the latter. Therefore, limited research is available on the relationship between the PCI and IRI based on the LTPP roads. This study aims to cast light on the relationship between these two performance indicators using LTPP data. To this end, 3,954 records of IRI and PCI were collated to determine the correlation. The aggregate goodness of fit was not satisfactory (R2 = 0.31) as the data was collected over 61 different states and provinces and in a 28-years timeline. So, in the next step the data was clustered into more meaningful groups based on location (province/state) and functional class in the hope of improving the goodness of fit. It was observed that the R2 within each group was substantially higher than the aggregate data, with some reaching above 0.70. Preparing an unprecedentedly large dataset gave us the freedom of segmenting the data into smaller and less noisy subsets, which can result in more robust models with higher coefficients of determination. Moreover, another dataset collected by Ontario Ministry of Transportation (MTO) was studied and the results were contrasted against each other. It was observed that the MTO data is more cohesive, and the correlation between the IRI and the PCI was stronger in that dataset. Finally, this study investigated the variations not explained by regression models, i.e. reasons that road sections can have an excellent PCI and poor IRI and vice versa. The findings show that the relationship between the PCI and IRI can vary significantly based on factors such as location, functional class and slope.   
Introduction   The International Roughness Index (IRI) is a popular pavement performance indicator in North America [1,2]. It was first introduced by World Bank and is a measure of roughness/smoothness of pavement [3]. The IRI is calculated by dividing the sum of the suspension motion of a driving vehicle by the length of the pavement section. Therefore, it is usually measured in m/km or in/mi. For a recently built pavement section, the IRI value may vary between 0.810 and 1.030 m/km depending on the type of pavement, slope variance and construction quality, but smaller values have been reported as well [4]. Several tools are used for collecting IRI data: inertial profiler, Dipstick® and rod and level [4]. Furthermore, at least two sources provide standardized guidelines for computing the IRI: ASTM E1926-08 [5] and AASHTO standard R 43 M/R 43-07 [6].   Another globally popular pavement performance indicator is the Pavement Condition Index (PCI). It is a numeric index between 0 and100,	which	was	originally	developed	by	the	US	Army	and	later standardized by the ASTM [7]. The PCI reflects the number of the distresses on the pavement and their extent. Therefore, a newly constructed road has a PCI of 100, and when it deteriorates over time and becomes impassable, its PCI approaches 0. Computing the PCI requires data about several types of distresses and their severity: potholes, fatigue cracking, rutting, block cracking, edge cracking, longitudinal and transverse cracking, patching, shoving, bleeding, polished aggregate and raveling.E-mail addresses: madeh.piryonesi@mail.utoronto.ca (S.M.

All rights reserved.   The bulk of the literature on pavement deterioration modeling has been developed based on the IRI [8]. Moreover, this index is among the performance measures that the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) requires DOTs to report [9]. However, most municipalities in Ontario rely on the PCI for representing their road conditions [10]. The FHWA National Performance Management Measure also reveals that a large number of cities in the US use the PCI as their primary method to assess road conditions [9]. Although the FHWA states advises against using these performance indicators interchangeably, but it encourages DOTs to use correlations to obtain an idea about missing performance indicators [4,9]. This necessitates conducting meticulous correlation analyses on the IRI and the PCI.   The goal of this study is to determine a correlation between the IRI and the PCI using LTPP roads. Despite being one of the largest and most widely used road performance datasets [2,11], very limited research is available on the correlation of the PCI and IRI based on this database as it does not include PCI values. Such analyses could be useful to DOTs or municipalities that cannot afford to collect data on both performance indicators. Furthermore, as the LTPP data includes distress types and other attributes related to these performance indicators, by using this database we can cast some light on the error that is not explainable by the regression equation. Therefore, another goal of this study is to explain the reasons behind the heterogeneity in the results of existing studies on the correlation between the IRI and PCI.   Since the introduction of the IRI, many researchers have investigated its relation to other pavement performance indicators [12–23]. The previous research, however, is fragmented, heterogeneous and based on different types and sources of data. Aultman-Hall et al. [22] used the data of the Connecticut Department of Transportation (ConnDOT) to determine a correlation between the IRI and pavement distresses. The only distress types they used were rutting and total amount of cracking. They described the correlations they found as “relatively weak”. The values of R2 for different lengths of pavement sections were as follows: 0.177 for 10 m, 0.242 for 30 m and 0.299 for 90 m. They also reported that even using neural networks did not improve the results and concluded that the IRI cannot be used to predict the overall condition of pavement. Their study was based on pavement sections shorter than 90 m, and the value of cracks was aggregated using a simple summation.   Other researchers have reported higher values of R2 when relating the IRI to other performance indicators. For example, Chandra et al. [18] related IRI to rutting, potholes, cracks, patchwork and raveling and reported an R2 value of 0.77. Their study was based on asphalt highways in India. Al-Suleiman and Shiyab [24] studied the correlation between the IRI and PSI using nonlinear regression and determined an R2 of 0.67 and 0.44 for two different classes of asphalt roads in Dubai.   More specifically, several researchers have studied the existing correlation between the IRI and the PCI [14,17–21]. Limited research on this topic is available based on the LTPP data. To the best knowledge of the author, there is only one study on the correlation between the PCI and IRI of LTPP roads, which was conducted by Park et al. [19]. They used a power regression model and reported a 0.59 R2. Their study had several limitations. First, the regression formula was developed based on only 20 pavement sections. Second, this small group of road sections were scattered over 11 states and provinces. This is an issue, as roads located in different jurisdictions could have the same PCI but substantially different roughness values as a result of variability in slope, pavement type and construction quality [25]. Third, their limited and scattered data could only represent a small range of IRI values from 0.727 m/km to 2.77 m/km, whereas the LTPP data covers a much broader range of IRI. This limitation makes the validity of their results questionable, especially for roads out of this range of roughness.   More recently, Bryce et al. [25] investigated the correlation between the PCI and the PSR (present serviceability rating) for LTPP road sections and reported that little correlation exists between the two. Consequently, they added a few other variables to their PSR prediction equation: area of patching, length of longitudinal and transverse cracking and rut depth. Using these variables and a nonlinear equation they achieved an R2 of 0.66. Their analyses, however, were only based on 159 sections distributed over multiple states. This large variation in their limited data must have adversely affected their calculations. In this study it is shown how by using a large enough dataset it is possible to cluster the data into smaller groups with less noise and find significant correlation. The findings of this study disprove the conjecture that no correlation exists between the PCI and the IRI.Fig. 1. IRI versus PCI for LTPP road sections.Methods   The LTPP data was retrieved and prepared using SQL-based queries. The LTPP database includes roughness data and the amount and severity of pavement distresses [26,27]. Therefore, IRI data does not require much preparation [2]. Only different numbers resulted from different runs of the test vehicle were averaged out. Preparation of PCI data, on the other hand, requires several steps: retrieving distress data; digitizing ASTM curves and finding their formulae; and embedding the equations in a computer program for PCI calculation. These tasks were conducted according to the approach detailed in Piryonesi and ElDiraby [28,29]. Next, retrieved IRI data was collated with PCI records to study the relationship. The criteria for joining IRI and PCI tables were as follows: the IRI and PCI survey must be conducted in the same year, and no maintenance action must be performed during this period. Altogether, 3,954 data points satisfied these conditions.Results   The IRI data points were plotted against PCI values. The points are shown in Fig. 1, and the equation for the fitted regression line is shown in Eq. (1). When compared to some of the results from previous research, the resulting R2 seems relatively low, but it is still higher than some of the reported values. However, the fact that the data for developing Fig. 1 and Eq. (1) is collected over a large geographic area, which includes 61 provinces, states and territories, should not be overlooked. Furthermore, this data is gathered over a time period of 26 years. This means that it was collected by different agencies, different surveyors, different types of technologies and under various environmental conditions.IRI =0.012PCI + 2.064, R2 = 0.302 (1) where, IRI is International Roughness Index, PCI is Pavement Condition Index, and R2 is the coefficient of determination.   To show that the existing variance in the data can heavily affect the correlation between the PCI and IRI, the data of Ontario provincial roads collected by Ontario Ministry of Transportation (MTO) was studied as well [30]. For this specific purpose, only the data for asphalt highways collected in 2014 were retrieved and collated in Fig. 2. This figure contains of 1,410 data points.   When comparing Figs. 1 and 2, we noticed a few differences. First, the latter includes only a handful of roads with a PCI lower than 40. Second, the MTO data is more concentrated around higher values of PCI and lower IRI. This higher density is because this database is only representing the provincial highways, whereas Fig. 1 includes all types of functional classes of roads with different maintenance histories. Another difference is that the dispersion of IRI values at PCI = 100 is much larger in Fig. 1, meaning that roads with an excellent PCI (i.e. no surface distress) have different IRI values. Also, Fig. 2 shows a strongerFig. 2. IRI versus PCI for MTO roads in 2014.correlation between the IRI and PCI, which is expressed in Eq. (2).IRI =0.045PCI + 5.024, R2 = 0.697 (2) where, IRI is International Roughness Index, PCI is Pavement Condition Index, and R2 is the coefficient of determination.   The high R2 of Eq. (2) contradicts the studies that reported that there is no or very weak correlation between the condition of roads and their roughness. Motivated by this high coefficient of determination, we clustered the data of Fig. 1 by state/province and functional class in a search for more robust models that predict the IRI more accurately. Figs. 3–7 show the IRI–PCI models and their R2 values for a specific functional class of roads within a certain state/province. The formula of regression line and the coefficient of determination is given in each figure.   Figs. 3–7 show that the resulting R2 for each subcategory of roads is significantly larger than that of Fig. 1 and Eq. (1). By grouping the data into meaningful clusters, some of the noise was removed, and significant correlations were found. Note that there still remains a difference between the data of Figs. 3–7 and that of Fig. 2 due to the time period in which data was collected. Furthermore, the PCI collected by the MTO is slightly different as it is based on five levels of severity and a more qualitative calculation process [31]. Furthermore, MTO’s PCI calculation method also entails a ride comfort score, which makes it even more correlated with performance measures related to roughness such as the IRI. Therefore, the formulae expressed above are only valid for a specific definition of PCI. This is an important point as adopting seemingly similar but inconsistent performance indicators is a common issue in pavement performance modeling [16].   In addition to R2 values, we examined t-statistics and P-values for all coefficients resulted from the equations discussed above. Table 1 includes the coefficients, their standard error, t-statistic, P-value (at a 0.05 significance level) and confidence intervals on the slope andFig. 3.

To check this assumption, the residual values of the models were visualized. All residual values were distributed around 0, and there was no evidence of an increase in variance or nonlinearity in the residuals. However, to ensure that the residuals are normality distributed a normality test, using Kolmogorov-Smirnov test [34], was conducted as well. Table 2 summarizes the results of the Kolmogorov-Smirnov normality test [34] for the residuals of these models. In this table n represents the sample size, α the significance level (in this case 0.05) and Dn,α the critical value to which the teststatistic is compared. The results of Table 2 clearly show that in all cases the test-statistic is smaller than the critical value, and there is not enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis. Thus, the residuals are normally distributed.   Since the sample sizes are different, and they are relatively small for Figs. 3–7, a fivefold cross-validation was performed to ensure the reliability of reported coefficients of determination. The results are presented in Table 3. The model numbers in this table correspond to figures presented above. The first number in these cross-validation outputs represents the mean of coefficient of determination and the second number shows the standard deviation. Note that since the sample size for Fig. 5 was too small, a threefold cross-validation was conducted instead.   The linear function is the simplest formula that could be fitted into data, and nonlinear functions could be tried as well. However, the point here is to show how, by retrieving a large enough dataset and clustering it into meaningful groups, it is possible to fit more accurate models to the same data extracted from the LTPP. Studying the similarities and differences of extracted formulae is beyond the scope of this research and could be the topic of a separate study. However, to make the current work as comprehensive as possible, we also checked if the regression models behave more robust in a logarithmic/exponential space. So, it was assumed that the relationship follows IRI = aPCIm. Then, taking a log from both sides will result in log(IRI) = m [log (PCI) + log(a)], or IRI' = mPCI'+z, where, IRI' = log(IRI), PCI'=log (PCI), and z = m*log(a). Fitting models in this discussed logarithmic space was performed for the roads within jurisdictions shown in Figs. 3–7. The results are shown in Table 4. This table shows that the resulting regression models were not necessarily more accurate than those mentioned above. An increase in R2 was observed only in two cases. This means that it is almost impossible to find a universally accurate statistical model to represent the relationship between PCI and IRI. The relationship varies depending on the location of roads and their other attributes. Note that these analyses were performed to cast some light on the relationship between the PCI and IRI in the LTPP data. While the correlations between these performance indicators can be used to obtain a rough idea of the relationships between different indices, the authors do not recommend using them to develop formal reporting or specifications.   Another point worth discussing is the variation in correlation values determined by different researchers. As discussed above, when relating the PCI and the IRI, researchers have reported extremely different R2 values, from 0.17 to 0.66, for different networks. Even in the current study, Figs. 3–7, contain a range of different R2 values from 0.47 to 0.82. So, investigating this source of variation is definitely worth. Data quality and reliability is always an issue. Multiple researchers have pointed out this issue in the literature [16,35–37]. However, assuming that the data is completely reliable, there are still variations in the data that cannot be explained by a regression model. This is because the IRI and the PCI measure different aspects of pavement health and each turn a blind eye on some other facets. Here, several examples are presented in Table 5 for further clarification.   Table 5 includes five different road sections, their recorded PCI and IRI values, slope variance and the dominant type of existing distress. The values for state code and project ID (i.e. STAT_CODE and SHRP_ID) are given as well. These two values uniquely define a road section in the LTPP database, the first defining the state/province and the second the project location. In this table the IRI is the average between left and right wheelpath IRI values. Both roads 1 and 2 have a PCI of 71, but road number 2 has a considerably larger IRI value. This variation stems from two reasons: different slope variances and different distress patterns. First, road 2 has a considerably larger slope variance. Furthermore, its dominant types of distresses are alligator and transverse crack. These defects are easily captured by a profilometer and are highly correlated with the IRI [38]. On the other hand, road number 1 has a smaller slope variance and high values of bleeding, a distress that is not necessarily causing more roughness on the road surface. So, the impact of both factors (i.e. distress type and slope variance) could be observed in these two roads. To cancel out the impact of distress, three roads with a PCI of 100 were studied as well: road 3, 4 and 5. It is shown that the first has a smaller IRI as a result of having a lower slope variance. IRI value grows for the other two roads with larger slope variances.Conclusion   In this paper the LTPP data was used to determine correlations between the IRI and PCI of asphalt roads. First, the PCI was calculated based on distress data and was collated with retrieved IRI values to discover possible correlations. The value of R2 for aggregate data was only 0.301; however, the goodness of fit was improved after the data was grouped into more meaningful categories based on the location and functional class of roads. In some cases, the resulting R2 was above 0.7, which is larger than what has been previously reported. This observation disproves the conjecture that no correlation exists between the IRI and the PCI. The large variation in the aggregate data suggests that the IRI and the PCI should be compared cautiously as they include a great deal of uncertainty, even though they are both standardized performance measures. Assuming that the data collection is conducted according to ASTM standard, the uncertainty still persists because of several reasons: surveying staff, data collection tools, slope variance and maintenance history of the road.   It was also shown that although the IRI and PCI are correlated, a road could have an excellent PCI but poor IRI. Also, two roads with the same PCI (e.g. satisfactory level) can have substantially different IRI values. To explain this variation the impact of two factors was investigated: distress type and slope variance. It was observed that some distresses, such as bleeding, decrease the PCI drastically but do not heavily impact the IRI. Another observation was that roads with the same PCI can have considerably different IRI values as a result of different slope variances. Therefore, an immediate recommendation of this study is to avoid using IRI and PCI interchangeably for decisionmaking without understanding the above-mentioned details about the road.   Finally, when comparing the LTPP and the MTO data, it was observed that the MTO data was more cohesive and showed significant correlations between the PCI and IRI. Nonetheless, the PCI calculation methodology proposed by the MTO is slightly different from that of the ASTM. The MTO considers five severity levels rather than three. More importantly, unlike the ASTM, it includes ride quality in PCI calculation. That is one of the reasons for higher the coefficient of determination. In addition, it should be pointed out that the MTO data does not have the dispersion of LTPP data as it was collected over one year, by the same agency for a single functional class of road. Paying attention to such details is vital when working with pavement performance data.CRediT authorship contribution statement   S.
