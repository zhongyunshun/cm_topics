AHIAGA-DAGBUI* and SIMON D. SMITHSchool of Engineering, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh EH9 3JL, UKReceived 4 November 2013; accepted 9 June 2014One of the main aims of any construction client is to procure a project within the limits of a predefined budget. However, most construction projects routinely overrun their cost estimates. Existing theories on construction cost overrun suggest a number of causes ranging from technical difficulties, optimism bias, managerial incompetence and strategic misrepresentation. However, much of the budgetary decision-making process in the early stages of a project is carried out in an environment of high uncertainty with little available information for accurate estimation. Using non-parametric bootstrapping and ensemble modelling in artificial neural networks, final project cost-forecasting models were developed with 1600 completed projects. This helped to extract information embedded in data on completed construction projects, in an attempt to address the problem of the dearth of information in the early stages of a project. It was found that 92% of the 100 validation predictions were within ±10% of the actual final cost of the project while 77% were within ±5% of actual final cost. This indicates the model’s ability to generalize satisfactorily when validated with new data. The models are being deployed within the operations of the industry partner involved in this research to help increase the reliability and accuracy of initial cost estimates.Keywords: Artificial neural networks, bootstrapping, cost overrun, data mining, ensemble modelling.   
IntroductionIn a construction project, the main obligations of a project team towards their client are usually reduced to concerns around functional requirements, specific quality, and delivery within an acceptable budget and time frame. Usually for most clients, the cost aspect of these requirements seems to rank highest. Thus, the estimates prepared at the initial stages of a project can play several important roles: they can form the basis of cost-benefit analysis, for selection of potential delivery partners, to support a to-build-or-not-to-build decision, and very often as a benchmark for future performance measure. As suggested by Kirkham and Brandon (2007), therefore, effective cost estimation must relate the design of the constructed facilities to their cost, so that while taking full account of quality, risks, likely scope changes, utility and appearance, the cost of a project is planned to be within the economic limits of expenditure. This stage in a project life cycle is particularly crucial as decisions made during the early stages of the development process carry more far-reaching economic consequences than the relatively limited decisions which can be made later in the process. Effective cost estimation is, therefore, so vital, it can seal a project’s financial fate, Nicholas (2004) notes.   However, in spite of the importance of cost estimation, it is undeniably neither simple nor straightforward because of the lack of information in the early stages of the project, Hegazy (2002) observes. Many projects consistently fail to meet initially set cost limits due to a number of causes ranging from the inability to accurately identify and quantify risk (Akintoye, 2000), error in estimation (Jennings, 2012), design changes and scope creep (Odeck, 2004; Love et al., 2012) and even suspicions of foul play and corruption (Wachs, 1990; Flyvbjerg et al., 2002).*Author for correspondence.

A vast amount of data is continuously generated by construction business transactions. As per due diligence or contractual requirements, most construction firms maintain copious information on each project undertaken. The amount of data generated by these firms presents both a challenge and an opportunity: a challenge to traditional methods of data analysis since the data are often complex, and usually, voluminous. On the other hand, construction firms stand a chance of gaining competitive edge and performance improvement by making their data work for them using detailed data mining. Fayyad et al. (1996) noted that the real value of storing data lies in the ability to exploit useful trends and patterns in the data to meet business or operational goals as well as for decision support and policymaking. Advances in the fields of data warehousing, artificial intelligence, statistics, visualization techniques and machine learning now make it possible for data to be transformed into a valuable asset by automating laborious but rewarding knowledge discovery in databases.   Data mining, simply described here as the analytical process of knowledge discovery in large databases, has found extensive application in industries such as business (cf. Apte et al., 2002) and medicine (cf. Koh and Tan, 2005). However, discussions with a number of construction companies during this research suggest that very few take advantage of the data available to them to develop business decision support tools. At best, their analysis is usually limited to basic sample statistics of averages or standard deviations. Against this backdrop, we collaborated with a major UK water infrastructure provider to investigate the use of data mining techniques to develop cost models that can be applied during the early estimation stages for more reliable cost forecasting. As already pointed out, a lack of information for reliable estimation has been identified as one of the main causes of cost growth in construction. It is hoped that data mining might help to convert historical data on projects into decision support systems, to partly address the problem of insufficient information for reliable estimation at the early stages of a project. The problem of cost growth and its causes are examined in the next section of the paper, followed by an overview of data mining and its applications. The data mining methodology was then applied to the problem of cost estimation in the construction industry using artificial neural networks (ANNs). Some practical implications of the research have been identified in the conclusions along with some possible barriers to effective data mining within the construction industry.Cost overrunsChan and Chan (2004) conducted a critical analysis of existing literature on construction benchmarking and proposed a framework of both qualitative and quantitative descriptors to evaluate the success of a construction project. They validated their framework using three hospital projects and noted that cost performance on a construction project remains one of the main measures of success even though there were other emerging qualitative measures like health and safety and environmental performance. We have previously investigated cost overruns on construction projects as part of a wider research into the potential use of artificial neural networks for construction cost estimation (AhiagaDagbui and Smith, 2012). We attempted to model final cost using non-traditional cost factors such as project location, access to site and procurement method. It became obvious that estimating the final cost of projects can be extremely difficult due to the complex web of cost-influencing factors that need to be considered. For a thorough and reliable estimate of final cost, the estimator has to be able to take into consideration factors such as the type of project, likely design and scope changes, risk and uncertainty, effect of policy and regulatory conditions, duration of project, type of client, ground conditions or tendering method. Trying to work out the influence of most of these variables at the inception stage of a project can be an exhausting task, if not altogether futile. Ignoring most of these factors also creates a recipe for possible cost growth, disputes, lawsuits and even project termination in some cases. Jennings (2012) employed a longitudinal ‘process-tracking’ approach to examine the dynamics between risk, optimism and uncertainty in construction and how these interact with the phenomenon of cost overruns using a case study of the 2012 London Olympic Games. Jennings found that a high level of uncertainty surrounds the cost estimation exercise especially in the initial stages of the project, thus making it difficult to produce reliable cost estimates. What is then resorted to, in most cases, is the use of some arbitrary percentages, the so-called contingency funds, which unfortunately has mostly failed to keep construction projects within budget.   The Auditor General of Western Australia assessed the management and performance of 20 capital-intensive non-residential projects including sports venues, schools and hospitals, undertaken within the state. The expected cost of all the projects at the time was A$6.157 billion, a staggering $3.275 billion (114%) more than the total original approved budget estimates. Fifteen of the 20 projects were expected to exceed their original approved budgets, of which four were expected to exceed their budgets by more than 200% (Auditor General of Western Australia, 2012).   The 2012 London Olympics bid was awarded at circa £2.4 billion in 2005. This was adjusted to about £9.3 billion in 2007 after significant scope changes. The project was eventually completed at £8.9 billion in 2010 (cf. National Audit Office, 2012). The City of Boston’s Central Artery project (popularly referred to as the Big Dig) was to cost US$2.6 billion but was completed at US$14.8 billion and seven years late in 2006 (Gelinas, 2007). The UK government-commissioned report in 1998 on construction industry performance indicated that over 50% of projects overspent their budget (Egan, 1998). A similar report around the same time in the US suggested that about 77% of projects exceed their budget, sometimes to the tune of over 200% (General Accounting Office, 1997). In more recent years, Flyvbjerg et al. (2002) sampled 258 infrastructure projects worth US$90 billion from 20 different countries and found that 90% of the projects experienced budget escalation and that infrastructure projects in particular have an 86% likelihood of exceeding their initial estimates. Alex et al. (2010) report up to 60% discrepancy between actual and estimated costs of over 800 water and sewer projects examined in their research. Flyvbjerg et al. (2004) thus concluded that little learning seemed to be taking place within the industry over time.Sources of overrunCost overrun in the construction industry has been attributed to a number of sources including technical error in design or estimation, managerial incompetence, risk and uncertainty, suspicions of foul play, deception and delusion, and even corruption. Akintoye and MacLeod (1997) conducted a questionnaire survey of generalcontractorsandprojectmanagersintheUKconstruction industry to ascertain their perception of risk and uncertainty as well as their use of various risk management techniques. They concluded that risk management practice was largely experience and judgement based and that formal risk management techniques such as Monte Carlo simulation or stochastic dominance wereseldomusedbecauseofdoubtsastotheirsuitability and lack of knowledge and understanding of these methods. The industry still seems to struggle to deal with identifying and quantifying the impact of risk events. This may probably be due to the nature of the industry: it is fragmented, complex, each project spans several years, is constructed in an environment open to inclement weather and has many different parties with varying business interests. Flanagan and Norman (1993) suggest that the task of risk management in most cases is so poorly performed that far too much risk is passively retained, an assertion supported by Jennings’ (2012) recent case study of the possible sources of cost growth on the 2012 London Olympic project.   Flyvbjerg et al. (2002), as well as Wachs (1989, 1990) point to optimism bias and strategic misrepresentation, or delusion and deception in other words, as possible causes of cost growth particularly on large publicly funded projects. Flyvbjerg et al. (2002) conducted a desk study analysis of the cost performance of 258 transportation projects worth US$90 billion and categorized the sources of cost overruns on construction projects into four groups: technical (error), psychological, economic and political. They concluded that cost escalation could not be adequately explained by estimation error, but was more likely caused by strategic misrepresentation: an intentional attempt to mislead. They observed that nine out of 10 of the projects experienced significant cost escalation over their construction period and that there was evidence of a systematic bias in the cost estimates as the overruns experienced did not appear to be randomly distributed. Flyvbjerg et al. (2002, p. 279) controversially concluded that the cost estimates used to decide whether projects should be given the go-ahead were ‘highly and systematically misleading’, strongly suggesting foul play by project promoters.   Further developments of the strategic misrepresentation perspective by Flyvbjerg led to theories based on optimism bias, after Weinstein (1980). Optimism bias can be explained as the cognitive disposition to evaluate possible negative future events in a fairer light than suggested by inference from the base rates. Flyvbjerg (2007) draws on this concept and suggested that decision-making in policy and infrastructure planning is flawed by the planning fallacy that we know, or at least are in control of all possible chains of events from project inception to completion, thereby leading to unjustifiable confidence in the prospects of the project and unrealistic estimates. While strategic misrepresentation is often intentional, according to Flyvbjerg et al., optimism bias is not. Flyvberg makes this distinction between the two concepts with the terms ‘deception’ and ‘delusion’ respectively (Flyvbjerg, 2008). It is plausible to reckon how strategic misrepresentation and optimism bias might work in tandem with business competition embedded in the lowest-bidder culture to often create an unrealistic low cost target of projects at the pre-construction phase of projects.   The proponents of another school of thought on cost overruns, referred to as the ‘evolution theorists’, include Love et al. (2012) as well as Gil and Lundrigan (2012). They argue that projects essentially evolve significantly between conception and completion so that it might be misleading in most cases to make a direct comparison between the costs at start and end of the project. Their thesis statement is straightforward: projects change, and when they do, they often come with increasing costs. Love et al. (2012, p. 560) provide a counter-perspective to the delusion and deception perspective on cost overruns, instead suggesting that the industry ‘move beyond strategic misrepresentation and optimism bias’ to embrace a more holistic understanding of the phenomenon that includes some level of the process and the social construct. They introduce the concept of ‘pathogens’ for example, the many events and actions that could not be accounted for at the initial stages of the project that eventually add on to expected cost as the main drivers of cost growth. They further argue that Flyvbjerg’s analyses are maybe too simplistic and not generalizable to all projects undertaken within the industry. Their argument would seem sustainable, especially in respect of small, privately funded projects that do not have strong political or public interest. Besides, it is difficult to draw valid distinctions, along a continuum of motivation, from reasonable and justifiable optimism, through overconfidence and delusion, culpable error, to deliberate deceit using just statistical analysis, the method adopted in Flyvbjerg’s works.   Love et al. (2005) also conducted a questionnaire survey of 161 construction professionals in the Australian construction industry and found that rework was one of the main contributors to escalation of cost. The main sources of rework as found in their work are ineffective use of information technology, staff turnover/allocation to other projects, incomplete design at the time of tender, insufficient time to prepare contract documentation and poor coordination between design team members. This conclusion is similar to that reached by Bordat et al. (2004) who found that the ‘dominant’ source of cost overrun was change orders due mainly to ‘errors and omissions’ in design. In a more recent research, Love et al. (2014) challenged the strategic misrepresentation and optimism bias perspective by Flyvbjerg (2008) as lacking in verifiable causality, and therefore limited in their application.   Ahiaga-Dagbui and Smith (2014) provide a more detailed discussion on other possible causes of overruns including technical and managerial difficulties and poor estimation, as well as the dynamics between cost growth and cognitive dispositions such as prospect theory (Kahneman and Tversky, 1979) and KrugerDunning effects (Kruger and Dunning, 1999).Measuring overrunsIt may be important to note here that much of the current literature and media furore on cost overrun seems to oversimplify its rather complex causes. As already noted, most construction projects, especially publicly funded capital-intensive projects tend to go through a long gestation period after project conception during which many changes to scope and accompanying costs occur. Sometimes the initial scheme bears little resemblance to the defined project, as was the case of the New Children Hospital in Western Australia (Auditor General of Western Australia, 2012). The initially approved budget for the hospital was A$207 million. The scope at this stage was to relocate the Princess Margaret Hospital to the Royal Perth Hospital. However, this scope completely changed during project definition to the construction of a totally new Medical Center at A$962 million, a cost increase of A$755 if taken on cursory examination. The Holyrood Project in Edinburgh also experienced a similar significant scope change, and thereby the astonishing cost growth recorded (see Audit Scotland, 2000, 2004). It seems erroneous, therefore, to make a direct comparison between the initial ‘estimate’ A and its final completion cost B: the two schemes are usually very different. More robust explanations of growth perhaps need to factor in process and product, as well as sources of changes to scope. Flyvbjerg’s works make a direct comparison between costs A and B, and wherever B > A, overruns are reported. It might be simplistic though, as pointed out by Love et al. (2012, 2014), but probably justifiable as estimate A is usually the estimate used to get project approval when publicly funded projects are being appraised. As it is often practically difficult to discontinue a project once a considerable amount of money has already been spent to get it started, it may thus be crucial for the industry to find more effective ways of project approval that deal better with underestimation of true costs and the setting of unrealistic cost targets.Going forward: estimating final costAlex et al. (2010) reviewed the cost performance on more than 800 construction projects of Canada’s Drainage and Maintenance Department and observed a discrepancy of up to 60% between estimated and actual final cost of projects completed between 1999 and 2004. They partly attributed this problem to the fact that the Department’s estimation process was heavily experienced based, relying largely on professional judgement, just as observed by Akintoye and MacLeod (1997). A potential downside of experienced-based estimation is the difficulty in thoroughly evaluating the complex relationships between the many cost-influencing variables already identified in this paper, or its inability to quickly generate different cost alternatives in a sort of what-if analysis. Furthermore, as noted by Okmen and O¨ ztas (2010) in their research on cost analysis within an environment of uncertainty, traditional cost estimation, i.e. the estimation of the cost of labour, equipment and materials, and making allowance for profits and overheads for individual construction items, is deterministic by nature. It therefore largely neglects and deals poorly with uncertainties and their correlation effects on cost, and is thereby deemed inadequate in reaching a reliable and realistic final cost. As an alternative to traditional estimation approaches, data mining, using the learning and generalization algorithms within artificial neural networks in combination with statistical bootstrapping and ensemble modelling is used to develop final cost models in this paper. The aim here is an attempt at circumventing the problems posed by uncertainty and lack of information for estimation in the early stages of a project.Data miningData mining, otherwise referred to as knowledge discoveryindatabases(KDD),isananalyticprocessforexploringlargeamountsofdatainsearchofconsistentpatterns, correlations and/or systematic relationships between variables, and then validating the findings by applying the detected patterns to new subsets of data (StatSoft Inc., 2008). Data mining attempts to scour databases to discover hidden patterns and relationships in order tofindpredictiveinformationforbusinessimprovement. Questions that traditionally required extensive hands-on analysis, experts and time, can potentially be quickly answered from a firm’s existing data.   Goldberg and Senator (1998) report the use of pattern discovery techniques by the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) of the United States Department of Treasury since 1993 to detect potential money laundering and fraudulent transactions from the analysis of about 200 000 large cash transactions per week. Using input factors such as age, housing, job title and account balance, Huang et al. (2007) developed a support vector machine credit scoring model to assess loan applicants’ creditworthiness in an attempt to limit a financing firm’s exposure to default. Hoffman et al. (1997) have also explored the use of data visualization and mining techniques for DNA sequencing in the area of cell biology. Ngai et al. (2009) provide a comprehensive review of data mining applications in customer relationship management, classifying these applications into four groups of customer identification, attraction, retention and development. One-to-one marketing and loyalty programmes targeted towards customer retention seem to receive the most attention from researchers.   Although data mining is yet to find extensive application in practice within the construction industry, construction management researchers have been investigating its applicability to different problem areas. Using some of the concepts of data mining and the theory of inventive problem-solving, Zhang et al. (2009) developed a value engineering knowledge management system (VE-KMS) that collects, retains and reuses knowledge from previous value engineering exercises in an attempt to streamline future exercises, making them more systematic, organized and problem-focused. Cheng et al. (2012) also developed EFSIMT, a hybrid fuzzy logic, support vector machines and genetic algorithm inference model to predict the compressive strength of high performance concrete using input factors such as the aggregate ratio, additives and working conditions. This kind of model allows for a more reliable prediction of the strength of a particular mix for design and quality control purposes as concrete strength is generally affected by a lot of factors. There is generally a higher rate of occupational injuries in the construction industry than in industries like manufacturing for example (cf. Larsson and Field, 2002). This might possibly be because of the dynamic and hazardous environment of a typical construction site. Liao and Perng (2008) thus employ association rule-based data mining to identify the characteristics of occupational injuries reported between 1999 and 2004 in the construction industry of Taiwan. Wet-weather related injuries and fatalities were particularly significant in their study.Data mining processData mining normally follows a generic process of business and data understanding, data preparation, modelling proper, evaluation of models, and deployment. It starts with the selection of relevant data from a data warehouse that contains information on organization and business transactions of the firm. The selected dataset is then pre-processed before actual data mining commences. The pre-processing stage ensures that the data are structured and presented to the model in the most suitable way as well as offering the modeller the chance to get to know the data thoroughly. Pre-processing typically involves steps such as removing of duplicate entries, sub-sampling, clustering, transformation, de-noising, normalization or feature extraction.Table 1	Framework for selecting a data mining techniqueData mining categoryData mining requirementData mining techniqueTechnique characteristicsRegressionClusteringClassificationVisualizationSummarizationPredictionPattern discoverySurveillancePerformanceMeasurementBusinessUnderstandingRegressionSupport vector machine (SVM)Self-organizing mapsGenetic algorithm, etc.FlexibilityAccuracy (precision)Power‘Interpretability’Ease of deployment   The next stage involves the actual modelling, where one or a combination of data mining techniques is applied to scour down the dataset to extract useful knowledge. This process can sometimes be an elaborate process involving the use of competitive evaluation of different models and approaches and deciding on the best model by some sort of bagging system (StatSoft Inc., 2011). Table 1 provides a framework for selecting a particular data mining technique. The type of modelling technique adopted depends on a number of factors, including the aim of the modelling exercise, the predictive performance required and the type of data available. Each modelling technique can also be evaluated in terms of its characteristics. For example, regarding ‘interpretability’, regression models generate an equation whose physical properties can be easily interpreted in terms of the variables used in explaining the phenomenon under study (Hair et al., 1998). Neural networks, on the other hand, do not produce any equation and have thus been derided as ‘black boxes’ by some researchers including Sarle (1994). However, their power and ability to model complex non-linear relationships between predictors make them particularly desirable for hard-to-learn problems and where a priori judgements about variable relationships cannot be justified (Adeli, 2001).   The results from the data mining stage are then evaluated and presented into some meaningful form to aid business decision-making. The knowledge generated is then validated by deploying the model in a real-life situation to test the model’s efficacy.DataThe data mining process described in the previous section of this paper is now applied to cost estimation within a partnering major water infrastructure client in the UK. The aim here is twofold: to develop decision support systems from existing data to complement the existing estimation process within our collaborating organization and also to investigate ways of circumventing the problem of lack of information for reliable estimation at the early stages of a project. Many crucial business decisions have to be made at this stage including tender evaluations, contract award, project feasibility or securing loans to finance the project. Our collaborating organization typically has three stage of estimation before inviting bids from contractors. The third stage estimate, Gate Three, is usually based on about 50–60% completed scope design and is used for evaluation of tenders after which detailed design is carried out by the selected contractor in a sort of design and build contract framework. The estimates produced by the models developed in this paper thus allow the organization to forecast its total likely commitment before tendering and before definitive estimates are available.   The data collection process involved an initial shadowing of the tendering and estimation procedure within the organization. We were thus allowed to be quasi members of the tendering team of the company on some of its projects to observe how the estimates were produced. It was also an opportunity to gain a firsthand understanding of how the data to be used for the modelling were generated and what different variables meant. The initial dataset contained over 5000 projects completed between 2000 and 2012. The scope of these projects varied from construction of major water treatment plants to minor repairs and upgrades. Project values ranged from a mere £1000 to £30 million and durations from three months to five years. The initial analysis involved drilling down into the database to find what might be useful in modelling final cost. To ensure some level of homogeneity in the data, K-means cluster analysis was used to create clusters of project cases based on duration and cost. V-fold crossvalidation with Mahalanobis distance was used to search for optimum number of clusters between two and 10 clusters. This distance measure was preferred to the popular square Euclidean distance because it helps account for the variance of each variable as well as the covariance between cost and duration of the project cases. The cases to be used in the modelling also had to be without significant missing data and fairly representative of the entire dataset. One of the clusters containing about 1600 projects completed between 2004 and 2012 was used for the models reported in this paper. One hundred of these project cases were selected using stratified random sampling with cost as the strata variable to be used for independent second stage validation of the final models. Stratified random sampling was used because this would hopefully allow for the selection of cases that are representative of the entire range of possible cases within the dataset. The remaining data were then split in a 70:15:15% ratio for training, testing and first stage validation respectively. Further details on the dataset used for the modelling are found in Table 2.Table 2	Overview of data used for model developmentSizeTypes of projectType oforganizationCost rangeDuration rangeYear spanc.1600Water mains, manholes, combined sewer overflows, repairs, upgradesClient£4000 to £15 millionmonth to 5years2004–12Data pre-processingThe pre-processing stage ensures that the data are structured and presented to the model in the most suitable way as well as offering the modeller the chance to get to understand the data thoroughly. Cost values were normalized to a 2012 baseline using the infrastructure resources cost indices by the Building Cost Information Services (2012) with a base year 2000. This allowed for cost values to be quite comparable across different years. Numerical predictors were further standardized to zScores using¼ xi lzscore(1) rwhere: zScore is the standardized value of a numerical input, xiμ is the mean of the numerical predictorσ is the standard deviation of the numerical predic-torSince neural networks were to be used for the actual modelling exercise, standardizing either input or target variable into a smaller range of variability would potentially aid the effective learning of the neural net while improving the numerical condition of the optimization problem (StatSoft Inc., 2008). If one input has a range of 0 to 1, while another has a range of 0 to 30 million, as was the case in the data that were used in this analysis, the net will expend most of its effort learning the second input to the possible exclusion of the first. All categorical variables were coded using a binary coding system.   The next stage involved deciding which predictors to use in the modelling exercise. It was easy to remove predictors such as project manager, project ID or year of completion from the set of predictors on precursory examination as they were likely not to be good predictors when the model is used in practice. Table 3 contains details on the set of initial predictors used at the beginning of the modelling.Cost model developmentData visualization using scatter and mean plots in the earlier stages of the modelling suggested non-linear relationships between most of the variables and final cost. Also, most of the predictors were categorical, rather than the usual numeric type. It was thus decided to use artificial neural networks (ANNs) for the actual modelling because of their ability to cope with non-linear relationships and categorical variables (cf. Anderson, 1995). An artificial neural network is an abstraction of the human brain with abilities to learn from experience and generalize based on acquired knowledge (Moselhi et al., 1991). It is also able to cope with multicollinearity, a statistical condition where two or more variables are highly correlated or dependent on each other thereby resulting in spurious predictions when both of those variables are included in the model (Marsh et al., 2004). Neural networks have previously been applied to forecasting tender price (Elhag and Boussabaine, 1998; Emsley et al., 2002) and for quantification of risk in construction by McKim (1993). See Moselhi et al. (1991) for a review of neural network application in construction management research.Standard modelsThe cost models were developed using an iterative process of fine-tuning the network parameters and inputs until acceptable error levels were achieved or when the model showed no further improvement. The model training began with a search for optimal model parameters. This was done in a trial and error manner to begin with, training several networks and examining them for possible performance improvement using the input factors in Table 3 and cost at completion as model output. Two different network architectures, the Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) and the Radial Basis Function (RBF), were tried at this stage. RBF models the relationship between inputs and targets in two phases: it first performs a probability distribution of the inputs before searching for relationships between the input and output space in the next stage (StatSoft Inc., 2008). MLPs on the other hand model using just the second stage of the RBF. The MLP models were superior to the RBF networks and so the rest of the modelling was carried out using just MLPs. It was found that the best trial results were achieved with MLPs with a single hidden layer having 3–10 nodes.   Consequently, using a custom range of 3–10 hidden nodes in one hidden layer, a dataset size split of 70% for training, 15% for testing and another 15% for firstTable 3	Initial list of variables for model developmentType of dataCategory1234Project information1	Tendering strategyOpen competitiveSelective competitiveNegotiatedSerial2	Procurement optionDesign-bid-buildDesign and buildManagement typesPartneringSite information3	Ground conditionContaminatedNon-contaminatedMade-up–4	Type of soilGoodModeratePoor–Other information5	Delivery partner*XYZ–6	Scope of projectNew-buildUpgradeRefurbishmentReplacement7	Purpose of projectWastewaterWaterGeneral–8	Operating regionNorthSouthEastWestNotes: Other factors include project duration (months) and awarded target cost (£).

These 10 networks were selected based on their overall performance, measured using the correlation coefficient between predicted and output values as well as the mean sum of mean squared errors (MSE). MSE is defined here as:	1 n	2MSE ¼ n XðOiTi Þ	(2)i¼1where Oi is the predicted final cost of the ith data case (output); Ti is the actual final cost of the ith data case (target) and n is the sample size.   The higher the MSE value, the poorer the network at generalization, whereas the higher the correlation coefficient, the better the network. The p-values of the correlation coefficients were also computed to measure their statistical significance. The higher the p-value, the less reliable the observed correlations. The best 10 retained networks were then further validated using the 100 independent validation cases that were selected using the stratified sampling at the beginning of the modelling exercise.   Five different activation functions, i.e. identity, logistic, tanh, exponential and the sine functions were iterated in both hidden and output layers, using gradient descent, conjugate descent and the Broyden-FletcherGoldfarb-Shanno (BFGS) training algorithms. See Fausett (1994) and Gurney (1997) for the fundamentals for neural network architectures, algorithms, or Skapura (1996) for a practical guide to developing neural network models. Early stopping, the process of halting training when the model error stops decreasing, was used to prevent memorizing or over-fitting the dataset in order to improve generalization. Over-fitted models perform very well on training and testing data, but fail to generalize satisfactorily when new ‘unseen’ cases are used to validate their performance.   Redundant predictors, those that do not add new information to the model because they basically contain the same information at another level with other variables, were detected using Spearman correlations, bivariate histograms or cross-tabulation. These were tendering strategy, procurement option and type of soil. This is likely due to the invariant nature of these predictors as most of the projects were procured through design and build contracts with a mix of open-competitive and negotiated tendering strategies. Type of soil was found to be linearly dependent on ground condition, thereby not making any additional contribution to the model’s output.   All the best 10 models identified at this stage had 12 input nodes from five input factors. These five significant input factors are purpose of project (wastewater, water or general), scope of project (new-build, upgrade or replacement), ground condition (contaminated or non-contaminated ground), delivery partner (anonymized as X, Y, Z) and estimated project duration. The models also had between three and seven nodes in a single hidden layer with one output, i.e. final cost. They were trained with a tanh or logistic activation function between their input and hidden layers, and an identity transfer function in the output layer.BootstrappingBootstrapping is a general technique, attributed to Efron (1992), for estimating sampling distributions that allow for treating the observed data as though it were the entire (discrete) statistical population (StatSoft Inc., 2011). It provides an avenue for using subsamples from a sample in a manner that addresses the variability and uncertainty in statistical inferences. Traditional approaches to statistical inference are based on the assumption of normality in the data distribution. This is reasonable and largely accepted but where this assumption is wrong, Efron (1992) warns that the corresponding sampling distribution of the statistic may be seriously questionable. In contrast, non-parametric bootstrapping provides a way to estimate a statistic of population without explicitly deriving the sample distribution. During the development of the models presented so far, the dataset was divided into three subsets for training, testing and validation. On a closer examination, this might be regrettable, as not all the data get used for training, testing or validation, and thus some level of information within the entire dataset is lost in the learning process. If bootstrapping is employed, a different split of data is used each time for training or testing so as to glean as much information as possible from the entire dataset.   Statisticians disagree though on the number of bootstrap samples (BS) necessary to produce reliable results. Most textbooks suggest choosing a sufficiently large bootstrap sample size without specific guidance on an optimum size. Efron and Tibshirani (1993), as well as Pattengale et al. (2009), however, suggest that a minimum of 100 or a maximum of 500 BS is generally sufficient in most cases. Bootstrapping was thus applied to the dataset in this manner: 600 different training, validation, testing BS sample sets were generated by perturbing the entire dataset for each model using sampling with replacement over a uniform probability distribution. This should ensure that as many data cases as possible get used in the training, validation or testing samples sets. With the same inputs, neural network architectures, activation functions, hidden layers and nodes used in the case of the standard sample models developed in the previous section, 1000 neural network models were then trained and tested, retaining the best 10 performing models just as before. The 10 retained models were then further validated using the 100 separate validation cases just as was done previously.   Figure 1 shows the performance of the best 10 models from both the standard and bootstrapped models validated with the 100 validation cases. It is obvious that bootstrapped models far outperform the standard models. While the bootstrapped models overestimated actual final cost by about 4% on average, the standard models overestimated by 8.35% on average. Furthermore, the bootstrapped models underestimated actual final cost with an average error of about –6%, whereas the standard models averaged about –10%. This performance improvement is likely due to the fact thatValidation ResultsFigure 1 Validation results (standard models vs bootstrapping)by using the 600 bootstrapped sample sets, the models were afforded a wider learning space than the standard models. The bootstrapped models were then carried forward for further analysis discussed below.Ensemble networkAll modelling techniques are prone to two main types of error, bias and variance, largely because models essentially try to reduce complicated problems into simple forms and then attempt to solve the ‘reduced’ problem using an imperfect finite dataset. Bias is the average error any particular model will make across different datasets whereas variance reflects the sensitivity of the model to a particular choice of dataset (StatSoft Inc., 2011). The use of ensembles can improve the results that are produced from individual models by combining them in a way that achieves some sort of compromise between variance and bias. Also known as committee methods (cf. Oza, 2006), ensembles attempt to leverage the power of multiple models to achieve better prediction accuracy than any of the individual models could on their own. It is perhaps a way of consulting a ‘committee of several experts’, the 10 different bootstrapped models in this case, before reaching a final decision either by averaging, voting or by ‘winner-takes-all’, whichever is most appropriate (see Jordan and Jacobs, 1994; Breiman, 1996). The result,Table 4 Summary of results (standard, bootstrapped and ensemble models)Average percentage errorModelOverestimateUnderestimateStandard models+8.35%–9.6%Bootstrapped models+3.84%–5.81%Ensemble model+2.33%–3.83%Table 5	Sample results from ensemble model validationCaseActual final cost (000)Ensemble prediction (000)Ensemble error (000)Ensemble absolute % error148464990(144)2.97215861590(4)0.25324 98623 76012264.91411 14310 9342091.88553285765(437)8.20637873723641.69717 34616 9673792.188413640331032.499311729941233.95101000939616.101117731674995.5812377936001794.7413209192178.1314396038101503.7915294300(6)2.041622962220763.311721042038663.141824824710.4019208192167.692020119741.99Table 6Summary of validation performance of ensemble modelNumber of casesPercentage of total validation setWithin ±5%7777±5% < x > ±10%1515Beyond ± 10%88Total100100at least in theory, is a model (the ensemble) that is more consistent in its predictions and on average, at least as good as the individual networks from which it was built. A weighted average algorithm was thus applied to combine the 10 best bootstrapped models to trade off bias and variance to improve performance.   Table 4 compares the performance of the ensemble model with the bootstrapped models and the standard models. It is obvious that significant improvement has been achieved by applying the ensemble technique to the 10 bootstrapped models.   In Table 5, details of a sample of 20 results out of the 100 validation cases used to test the ensemble model are highlighted. It shows a comparison between the ensemble final cost prediction and the actual final cost of the project, with a measure of the actual monetary error observed.   Table 6 shows a summary the performance of the ensemble model for all the 100 validation cases. Note that 92% of the 100 validation predictions were within ±10% of the actual final cost of the project with 77% within ±5% of actual final cost. Only eight out of the 100 validations had predictions beyond ±10% of the final cost of the project case.ConclusionA lot of project and cost information is usually generated on any one particular construction project. If this is done in a meaningful and retrievable manner for a number of projects over time, a vast database of potentially valuable assets results. This can be converted into valuable decision support systems using data mining methodologies. The possibilities are that these decision support systems could help construction practitioners in making better informed and reliable decisions as well as reducing the time and resources spent in reaching these decisions.   Cost growth, attributed to a number of causes including the unavailability and uncertainty of necessary information for reliable estimation at the early stages of a project, remains one of the major problems in the construction industry. We make a case for using data mining in modern construction management as a key business tool to help transform information embedded in construction data into decision support systems that can complement traditional estimation methods for more reliable final cost forecasting. Using a combination of non-parametric bootstrapping and ensemble modelling in artificial neural networks, cost models were developed to estimate the final construction cost of water infrastructure projects. It was found that 92% of the 100 validation predictions were within ±10% of the actual final cost of the project with 77% within ±5% of actual final cost. We are now exploring avenues of transforming the models into standalone desktop applications for deployment within the operations of the industry partner that collaborated in this research.   The models developed will be particularly useful at the pre-contract stage of the partnering construction firm that participated in this research as it will provide a benchmark for evaluating submitted tenders. They could further allow the quick generation of various alternative solutions for a construction project using ‘what-if’ analysis for the purposes of comparison. The method and approach adopted to develop the models can be extended to even more detailed estimation so long as relevant data can be acquired. It must be pointed out that reliable cost planning and estimation forms only one aspect of dealing with cost growth in construction. A more holistic approach must include effective project governance and client leadership, accountability and measures of cost control. Also, an effective data mining exercise does depend heavily on both quantity and quality of data. Companies that want to employ data mining techniques thus have to be intentional in how they collect and store their data, making sure these are relevant business and operational data to solve the problem at hand.ReferencesAdeli, H.
