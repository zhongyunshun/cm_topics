1 . Introduction 
The construction industry is a vital component of global infrastructure development, encompassing a broad spectrum of projects ranging from residential and commercial buildings to large-scale infrastructure such as bridges, roads, and dams (Adetola et al., 2011) [9]. Characterized by its diverse and multifaceted nature, the construction sector involves intricate planning, collaboration among various stakeholders, and the execution of complex tasks. This industry plays a pivotal role in economic growth, job creation, and the overall well-being of societies. The construction sector is uniquely positioned as a driving force behind urbanization and modernization. As populations continue to grow, the demand for new and improved infrastructure has intensified, placing unprecedented pressure on construction projects to be executed with precision, speed, and efficiency (Evans and Annunziata, 2012) [20]. However, despite its significance, the construction industry is often plagued by challenges such as project delays, budget overruns, and safety concerns. These challenges underscore the need for innovative solutions that can revolutionize traditional construction management approaches (Okem et al., 2023) [41]. Efficiency and cost-effectiveness are critical factors in the success of construction projects. The construction industry operates within a competitive environment where stakeholders, including clients, contractors, and regulatory bodies, demand optimal project outcomes within stipulated budgets and timelines. Inefficiencies in project management can result in delays, increased costs, and diminished overall project quality. Timely project completion is crucial not only for meeting client expectations but also for minimizing disruptions to communities and ensuring a return on investment for project financiers. Cost-effectiveness, on the other hand, is integral to the financial sustainability of construction projects. Effective cost management enables stakeholders to allocate resources judiciously, enhance profitability, and remain competitive in the marketplace. Artificial Intelligence (AI) has emerged as a transformative force across various industries, and its potential in construction management is gaining increasing recognition (Odonkor et al., 2024). AI encompasses technologies that enable machines to simulate human intelligence, learning from data, adapting to new information, and performing tasks that typically require human cognitive abilities. In the context of construction management, AI offers a paradigm shift by introducing advanced data analytics, predictive modeling, and automation. AI's potential in construction management lies in its ability to analyze vast amounts of data, identify patterns, and make predictions to optimize decision-making processes (Okem et al., 2023) [41].
