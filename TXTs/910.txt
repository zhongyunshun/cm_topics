Quality in Construction Management: An Exploratory Study 
4 	1. Introduction 
5 
6 	Jung and Wang (2006) and Lam and Thomas (2006) stated that top managers have been 
7 
8 focusing on the need for applying quality philosophies to achieve high performance levels 
9 among various components and procedures. There has been increased interest within the 
10 
11 	construction management community in exploring possibilities for applying quality knowledge 
12 
13 gained from manufacturing and other industrial sectors to the problems of managing the 14 construction process (Abdel Salam and Gad, 2009). Unfortunately, contractors rarely have a 
15 
16 	realistic idea of how much profit they are losing by not attaining an acceptable level of quality. 
17 
18 Turk (2006) stated that quality may sometimes be ignored in the construction industry in order to 19 cut the costs and shorten the project duration. However, it is believed that the benefits of higher 20 
21 	customer satisfaction, better quality products, and higher market share are often obtained 
22 
23 following the adoption of quality by construction companies (Pheng and Teo, 2004). Recent 
24 events in developing countries coupled with restructuring of economics, emergence of the world 
25 
26 	trade organization and the rising price of oil are expected to yield an unprecedented growth in 
27 
28 constructions. Consequently, a huge number of large scale projects are currently in planning and 
29 contract awarding phase (Wanberg et al., 2013). The construction industry has experienced 
30 
31 	growth during the boom that occurred in developing countries in the last decade encouraging 
32 
33 investments in the industry and raising the importance of deploying management philosophies 34 advancement to this industrial segment. The effects of quality on a business are numerous and 
35 
36 have improved the productivity of design and project management and now have become vital to 37 
38 	construction business to survive and have a competitive edge. 
39 
40 	In response, this paper explores the factors affecting quality in construction management 41 
42 (housing sector) in a developing country (Jordan). Jordan is looking to develop a better 
43 management strategy for its construction projects, and this is a priority for other developing 44 
45 	countries too (JEA, 2013). Our aim in this paper is to identify the relative importance of factors 
46 
47 affecting quality in the Jordanian housing sector. This study addresses the following research 48 objectives: (1) to identify the factors affecting quality in the housing sector, (2) to examine the 
49 
50 relative importance (e.g. highest and lowest) of such factors from the view point of architects 51 
52 	and contractors, and (3) to develop an integrated conceptual framework for quality factors. 
53 
54 	The rest of this paper is structured as follows: quality, quality in construction, and factors 
55 
56 	affecting quality in the literature are reviewed, the research methodology is discussed, findings 57 
58 	and discussion follows, and the final section includes conclusions and contributions.

2. Literature Review 
2.1 Quality 
 
 	The success of a project found in the literature depends on the project quality as a key concept 
6 
7 (Wanberg et al., 2013, Romeo et al., 2014). Arditi and Gunaydin, (1997) define the concept of 
8 quality as meeting the legal, aesthetic and functional requirements of a project. Eng and Yousef 
9 
10 	(2003) explain quality as both a philosophy and a set of guiding principles that represents a 
11 
12 	continuously improving organization. Quality can be translated into the quality dimensions that 13 	include:    levels    of    quality,    reliability   and   safety,    quality   performance,    durability, and 
14 
15 	serviceability (McGoerge and Plamer, 2000; Luu et al., 2008; Wanberg et al., 2013). Jung and 
16 
17 Wang (2006) argue that it is the role of management to ensure the achievement of established 
18 requirements in a project as competition increases and change occurs in the business world. 
19 
20 	Understanding how closely the project conforms to its requirements, a high quality project can 
21 
22 be described by such terms as ease in understanding drawings, level of conflict in drawings and 
23 specifications, construction economy, ease of operation and maintenance, and energy efficiency 
24 
25 	(Ardti and Gunaydin, 1997). According to Al Nofal et al., (2005) and Jraisat and Sawalha 
26 
27 (2013), quality requires radical change to traditional management practices. Quality is one of the 
28 most complex practices for any company; it requires implementing a new way of managing 
29 
30 	business and culture which not only affects the whole organizational process and employees but 31 
32 	also the allocation of significant resources (Santos et al., 2002; Jung, 2009). 
33 
34 
35 	Quality needs control which is the specific implementation&  of the quality assurance program. 
36 
37 Effective control for quality reduces the possibilities of change,Reliab mistakes and omissions, which 
38 in turn result in fewer conflicts and disputes. Most of the engineers and architects were in total 
39 
41 	il 
40 	control during the design phase. During the construction phase, they carried out a role described 
42 as 'supervision', insuring that the owner received his money's worth in terms of quality. 
43 Recently, owners became increasingly concerned with cost and schedule, areas where design 
44 
45 professionals were not providing good control. Engineers and architects must work together to 
46 47 	achieve specified goals of quality and liability control, recognizing that each person and each 
49 	ity 
48 	activity affects and in turn is affected by others. As competition increases and changes occur in 
50 	the business world, companies look for high levels of effectiveness across all functions and 
51 
52 	processes and choose quality management as a strategy to stay in the business. 	M

2.2 Quality in Construction 
In a construction project, quality management has been widely used by world-class companies to 
4 	ensure 	successful 	projects 	delivery 	(Aichouni 	et al., 2014). 	The 	interactions 	and 5
6 	interrelationships  between  key  participants  (e.g.  the  client,  the  architect  and  the  contractor) 
8 ournalargely  determine  the  overall  performance  of  the  construction  project. 	Notwithstanding  this 7 
9 mutual dependency, the performance of individual participants remains important because the 
10 
11 	l overall performance is a function of the performance of each participant (Soetanto and Proverbs, 
12 
13 2002; Lianying and Weijie, 2013). According to Rwelamila and Wisemant (1995), Arditi and 
14 Gunaydin (1997), Turk (2006) and Saeed and Hasan, (2012), quality in the construction industry 
1516  	can be defined as meeting the requirements of the designer, constructor and regulatory agencies 
17 
18 as well as the owner. Based on the three studies above, quality can be characterized based on 
19 meeting the requirementsof of the  owner (e.g. functional adequacy, completion time, budget; and 
20 
21 	lifecycle costs), design professional (e.g. well-defined scope, qualified staff, adequate 
23 information prior to design, provisions for decisions by owner and design professional,Qualit	 and 22 
24 contracting to perform work), constructor (e.g. contract plans, specifications, timely decisions, 
25 
26 	and  contracting 	to performy work),  and regulatory agencies (e.g. public safety and health, 
27 
28 environmental considerations, protection of public property, and laws and regulations). 
29 Moreover, one should also differentiate between product quality (the physical product itself) and 
30 
31 	the process quality (the activities that causes the product to be either acceptable or not) in a 
32 
33 project (Culp et al., 1993). For example, "product quality" in the construction industry may refer 
34 to achieving quality in the materials, equipment and technology&  that go into a structure building, 
35 
36 	where "process quality" may refer to achieving quality in theReliab way the project is managed in the 
37 
38 three main phases of construction process which are planning and designing phase, construction 
39 phase, and operation and maintenance phase (Burati and Oswald, 1993; Arditi and Gunaydin, 
40 
41 	1997; Lai and Cheng, 2003). 	il 
42 
43 
44 The construction industry and its quality presently are facing urgency of shaping a sustainable 45 construction process (Zhai et al., 2014).The role of quality in construction has been emphasized 
46 
47 	by the use of various aspects of quality tools and techniques (e.g. Metri, 2005). Many 
49 organizations are frustrated in their effort to improve quality because these companiesity have  48 
50 exclusively focused on financial measures instead of quality measures (Torbica and Stroh, 1999; 
51 
52 	Sharmma and Gudanne, 2002). Construction firms, therefore, need to understand the quality 
54 factors for their success in order to establish quality factors for construction firms (Saeed Mand  53 
55 Hasan, 2012). Although quality has been widely implemented in the Japanese construction 
56 
57 	industry since the 1980s and in the American construction field since the 1990s, it has not yet 
58 
59 	been implemented successfully in developing countries (Abdel-Razek, 1998; Hiyassat, 2000; 60 	Kazaz et al., 2004; Abdel Salam and Gad, 2009). Many studies have demonstrated that project 
http://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/ijqrm 
management action is a key element in achieving quality in construction. The success of quality 
management depends heavily on management practices. These practices include: motivation by 
 the contractor’s senior management, commitment of top managers to site management (Abdel-  Razek, 1998; Kaye and Anderson, 1999), and integration of continuous improvement activities 
8 	ourna
67 	into the strategic goals across the whole organization, across boundaries and at all levels (Kaye 
9 	and Anderson, 1999). Contractors, for example, need to define their objectives by creating a 
11 	l 
10 	harmony through mutual co-ordination among all parties (Asim et al., 2013). 
12 
13 	According to Kazaz and Birgonul (2005), Turk (2006) and Haseeb et al., (2011), construction 
14 
15 firms have some deficiencies in getting stability in a quality concept when their business 16 structures use temporary labors and change their location constantly and consequently. 
19 	of 
1718  	Furthermore, construction projects are widely seen as unpredictable in terms of delivery time, 
20 budget, profitability and the standards of quality expected (Love et al., 2000). Some differences 
21 must be considered when applying a quality program to construction projects (Arditi and 
2223  	Gunaydin, 1997; Pheng andQualit Teo, 2004; Romeo et al., 2014). These differences illustrate that 
24 
25 almost all construction projects are single order-production products, each construction 
26 production site always displaysy different  conditions; the life-cycle of a construction project is 
27 
28 	much longer than the life-cycle of most manufactured products, and there is no uniform standard 
29 
30 in evaluating overall construction quality. Thus, construction projects usually are evaluated 31 subjectively, and the participants in the construction project (e.g. owner, designer, general 3233  contractor, subcontractor, material supplier, etc.) differ for each project. 
35 &

36 2.3 Factors Affecting Quality in Construction Management Reliab
37 
38 
39 	In  construction  projects,  there  is  a  need  for  a  framework  for  evaluating  quality  to  assist 
41 	il 
40 	construction clients in selecting quality-oriented organizations that will provide higher quality 
42 products and processes within budget and on schedule (Idrus and Sodangi, 2010, Dina et al., 
43 2010). Porter and Parker (1993) stated that in managing quality, some organizations focus on 
4445  	specific areas such as training, leadership, and benchmarking while others take a holistic 
46 
47 	approach for quality factors. Haupt and Whiteman (2004) have conducted a study in the U.S.A 
4950  commitment and involvement, customer satisfaction, planning, participative managementity style,  48 through a literature review and a survey of contractors to identify factors (e.g. management 
51 
52 continuous improvement measurement, rewards for quality contribution, and training of M 
53 workers) affecting the operations of a construction jobsite. Pheng and Hong (2005) have done a 
5455  	study in Singapore which involved the participation of project managers in the construction 
56 
57 industry. A survey was used and the respondents generated eight factors and the relative 
58 importance of each factor was determined. For example, the first factor in order of priority was 59 
60 	total commitment .Second, was strategic quality management, and followed by customer-driven 
http://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/ijqrm 

service, eliminating rework, teamwork, and training, empowering and respecting people. Furthermore, Lam et al. (2008) have explored the extent of quality in Hong Kong large-sized 
public building contractors. They concluded that the contractors should pay more attention first to the factors of strategic planning, human resources management, and leadership in order to 
67	attain the goal of continuous improvement then to the factors of process management, customer 
8 
9 	and market focus, measurement, and analysis and knowledge management. 
10 
11 
12 Previous  studies  highlighted  the  factors  affecting  the  quality  of  construction.  Each  study has 
13 contributed  to  identifying  some  factors  affecting  quality.  However,  there  are  few  published 
14 
15 works that comprehensively address the factors specifically affecting the quality of construction 
16 in different parts of the world. Researchers still differ in their perceptions as to what should be 
1718  	emphasized most among the different factors affecting quality. Moreover, few studies have been 
19 
20 conducted in the Middle East regions that are addressing quality factors in construction. 
21 Fourteen quality frameworks for construction industry have been promoted by different authors, 
2223  	for the purpose of establishing construction quality factors in this study. A detailed analysisQualit	 of 
24 25 	the frameworks is carried out and presented in Table 1.

31 A  careful balance  between  the  owners  requirements  of the  project costs and  schedules, desired 
32 operating  characteristics,  materials  of  construction,  etc.  and  the  adequate  time  and  budget to 
33 
35 	& 
34 	meet those requirements during the design process is essential. Owners  balance  their 
36 requirements against economic considerations and, in some cases, against chance of failure. The 
37 constructor is responsible for the means, methods, techniques, sequencesReliab, and procedures of 
38 
39 construction, as well as safety precautions and programs during the construction process. Project 41 requirements are the key factors that define quality in the process of construction. After a review il 
40 
42 	of  the literature on quality factors in construction,  it appears that not all the factors have the 
43 
44 	same frequency and importance but they complement one another. Accordingly, relying on the 
45 
46 previous research findings about factors affecting quality in construction, this study uses  13 
47 quality factors as the most relevant. Table 2 lists the most important factors  and  literature 
48

3. Research Methodology 
Due to the dearth of real data relating to quality in the Jordanian housing projects, the 
researchers use an exploratory method to identify the most  related quality factors.  The present 
6
8 	ourna
7 	aim of this study was  identified: factors affecting quality in the  Jordanian housing sector and 
9 their relative importance. This exploratory research includes two phases of extensive  review of 
11  
10 the literature and a survey questionnaire by personal interviews in the housing sector in Jordan. 
12 The research design started with identifying a research problem, and then it provided a review of 
13 
14 the available literature in order to understand previous research in quality and relevant fields. 15 This has led to a determination of the key aim and objectives, and then providing the initial 16 17 conceptual framework for quality factors. 
19 	of 
18 
The survey was conducted by means of structured personal interviews within two months 
20 
21 	(September and October, 2013), carried out face to face for checking the information accuracy, 
23 and developing an understandingQualit of quality factors based on the designed questionnaire. During 22 
24 the interviews, interviewees were briefed on research problem, research objectives and quality 
25 
26 	factors. The interviews were conducted at the premises of the selected companies that agreedy 	 to 
27 
28 participate. The questionnaires were answered by contractors and architects who were in charge 
29 of quality awareness to ensure that the respondent has the necessary knowledge to respond. All 30 
31 	the companies included in the survey were located in Amman due the constraints of time and 
32 
33 	cost. Amman is considered to be the main economic hub of the country, and 77 % of the housing 
35 	& 
34 projects are concentrated there (JEA, 2013).Most of the survey questions were adopted from 
36 	previous literature that had been used to determine the factors affecting quality in  construction. 
37 
38 	The questionnaire was made of two parts: the demographic information of respondents  and Reliab
39 
41 measure on a five-point likert scale to ensure consistency and the ease of data computation. The il quality factors. The importance of factors affecting quality was measured using a perceptual 
40 
42 
43 perceptual measures are in the form of attitude statements with (1 = totally disagree,  2  = 
44 generally disagree, 3 = somewhat agree, 4 = generally agree, and 5 = totally agree). It was 
45 
46 	important to have a valid instrument for measurement, so the process of developing the 
47 
49 	ity 
48 	questionnaire ended with a pre-test, which were used to modify and eliminate a number of 
variables. However, it was found to be valid on the basis of our study. The list of ISO 9000 
50 51 	certified companies (as of June, 2013) was obtained from Jordan Institution for Standards and 
52 M 
53 Metrology. This list contained the name, telephone and fax number and the certification body for 
54 
283 certified firms in Jordan. Of these firms, only four of them  are  construction  firms. 
55 
56 	Companies that were  ISO 9000 certified were  used in the population to capture the benefits and 
57 
58 	to ensure the maturity of the system in the firms. 
 59 
An exploratory pilot study was conducted at Jordanian Engineering Association (JEA), Jordan Construction Contractors Association (JCCA), Ministry of Public Work and Housing, Ministry 
of Industry and Trade (MIT), to seek out detailed information regarding the potential 
participants constituting the housing sector in Jordan. The population of the study consists of 
8 	ourna
67	working contractors and architects in the Jordanian housing sector obtained from the lists of 
9 	JEA, JCCA and MIT. These lists were carefully verified and cross-checked to ensure complete 
11 	l 
10 	and up-to-date information, as follows: 
12 
13 	Contractors: contracting companies are classified by Ministry of Public Work and Housing into 
14 
15 	six classes according to their capital, and their experience in completing projects with a 16 	minimum total value. As considerably meeting in JCCA, the classes which usually take the 
17 
19 	of 
18 	housing projects are classes D and E as summarized in Table 3 which comprise 243 companies 
20 	(JCCA, 2013).

25 	Architectural firms, consulting companies and engineering offices: they represent a number of 
27 	1198 companies and offices (JEA, 2013). According to the JEA, architectural firms, consulting 
28 
29 companies and  engineering offices share  similar architectural  activities;  thus they are   classified 
30 under the same category. This point was taken into consideration when the population of the 
31 
32 study was selected, and for the purpose of the study, the researchers chose 85 companies and 
33 offices of  which  their  capital  exceeds JOD  10000  (MIT,  2013;  JEA,  2013).The  sampling was 
3435  	confined to specific types of companies conforming to& the criteria  set by the researchers: 
36 	Reliab
37 contracting companies where their capital between JOD 20000 and JOD 50000 (class D and E) 
38 and architectural companies with capital in excess of JOD 10000. 
39 
40 
41 	The researchers followed a census sampling approach "whereil the  sample size equals the 
42 
43 population size" .Therefore the sample size for contractors equals 243 while the sample size for 
44 the architects is 85.The response rates were: 61.2 % and 22.6 % for architects and contractors 
4546  	respectively. This study implemented a number of statistical techniques and procedures to 
47 
48 answer the questions of study. Descriptive statistics and reliability analysis were carried out to 
49 estimate the internal consistency of items, where Cronbach’s coefficient, α, was selectedity for this  
5051  	test. Then, t-test (one-tailed) at 95 % confidence level was conducted among the means of 
52 M 
53 responses from the two groups (contractors and architects) to check any significant differences 
54 among the groups’ perceptions regarding the importance of various factors. All statistical 
5556  	procedures were estimated using Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 15.0 
57 
58 (Gerber   and Finn,  2005). 	In order to increase the validity of the research findings, the 
59 researchers also use cause-effect diagram (Fishbone) in the analysis procedure in order to 
 
explore the theoretical links of the factors affection quality in the Jordanian housing sector. “The Fishbone Diagram” is easy to use and is an effective cause-and-effect technique. The diagram 
refers to its use in identifying the causes of various quality characteristics, including problems 
(Ozeki and Asaka, 1990). This type of analysis will illustrate the most important quality factors 
8 	ourna
67	and their variables in order to support the new proposed conceptual framework for this study.

15 The  responses  indicated  that  the  majority  of  contractors  who  participated  in  the  study  were 
16 100% male and 49.1% with ages ranging between 41 and 50 years old. The contractors were 
17 
19 	of 
18 	well experienced professionals and were able to give reliable data. The respondents over five 
20 years of experience in the construction industry were 89.9% and over 49.1% of them had over a 
21 ten years’ experience. All of the respondents have graduated from high school  and  72.7%  of 
22 
23 	them hold bachelor degrees. Amongst the architectural companies, the large proportion is 65.4% Qualit
24 
26 	about 55.8% were less than 40 years, 78.8% of them hold bachelor degrees, and 15.4% of the y 25 	of the respondents which were male and 34.6% were female. The statistical results  show that 
27 
28 	participants have completed graduated studies. About 11.5% of the respondents had less than 5 
29 
30 years’ experience, 21.2% between 6-10 years, 55.8% between 10-15 years, and 11.5% over 15

36 	An instrument has content validity if researchers agree that the instrument is made up of a group Reliab
37 
38 	of items covering the issues to be measured. The researchers utilized the available literature to 
39 
40 ensure the questionnaire validity. The pre-test consisted of a first revision of the  questionnaire 
41 with five Jordanian academic people in order to ensure technical accuracy and clarity and to il 
42 
43 	improve the questionnaire. The internal consistency method was used to measure construct 
44 
45 reliability by the use of Cronbach’s alpha. In the present research, the coefficient of Cronbach’s 
46 alpha for all factors was 0.82. This indicates a high level of reliability which is above the 
47 
49 	the Jordanian housing sector was determined by taking the respective average scores ofity the  48 	recommended minimum level 0.60 for social sciences. The ranking of factors affecting quality in

The homogeneity of variance must be examined to know if the variances  assumed are  equal  or not at significance ‘p’ of 95% (α = 0.05), then t-test is conducted. For this purpose, the researchers examine these statistical hypotheses, if significance ‘p’ value is less than 0.05; then

49 	ity 
48 	contractors and architects combined. However, there is no significant difference according to the 
50 	mean of overall averages of the contractors and architects concerning this factor. Table 11 shows 
51 
52 that this factor (education and training, involvement, and teamwork) is considered as the most 
53 important factor which affects quality in many countries. 	M

Research results have revealed that education and training are the most important elements affecting quality. This result is in agreement with the conclusion drawn by Chan et al.(2006), 
Lam et al. (2008) and Lai and Cheng (2003) in Chinese companies where it was conducted for public housing. It is in agreement with pheng and Hong (2005) in Singaporean companies from 
8 	ourna
67	the view point of contractors. The result also is in agreement with the study of Sharmma and 
9 	Gudanne (2002) in Australlian construction companies that stated that they had an on going 
1112  l Gunaydin (1997) emphasized that training should be targeted to every level of the company and 10 quality training programmes as an important quality strategy. In the U.S.A, a study by Arditi and 
13 
14 in all stages of construction. Findings from an Egyptian survey in 1998 by Abed-Razek reflected 
15 that the most important factor was up-grading for the current training methods. The entire 
16 
17 	project team (contractor, subcontractor, supplier, designer, project manager,  and customer) must 
18 
19 	be involved in the quality process (Pheng and Teo, 1996). Severof 	al authors have suggested the 
20 
21 	importance of involvement in decision making which enhances the individuals’ self-esteem and 
23 	Qualit
22 improves ability to solve problems (e.g. Metri, 2005; Fotopoulos and  Psomas,  2009).  Each 24 project also requires an effective teamwork on jobsite where both the construction managers and 26 workers require a paradigm shift to team approach which will lead to a better support to all y 25 
27 	members (Hellard, 1991; Haupt and Whiteman, 2004; Pheng and Hong, 2005). 
28 
29 
30 	Customer Satisfaction is the second most important factor. It is not surprising that most 31 	respondents understood the importance of customer satisfaction and emphasized the satisfaction 
32 
33 	of customers in support of overall quality. Also, there is no significant difference in the mean of 
35 	responses of contractors and architects regarding this factor (Table 12).&  34 
36 
37 	Table 12. Supportive Studies of Customer Satisfaction. Reliab
38 
39 
40 	As shown in Table 12, this study is in agreement with studies of U.K, U.S.A,  Singapore, il 
41 
42 	Malaysia, India, Australia, and China. In construction, quality consciously focuses all parties to 
43 
44 the common goal of systematically identifying and meeting the customers’ requirements as the 
45 superordinate goal where customers’ requirements are increasingly complex and expectations 
46 
47 	uncertain. However, a large proportion of migrant labor may exacerbate these difficulties,  and 
49 the application of quality can become difficult (Pheng and Wei, 1996). Customer satisfaction is ity 48 
50 achieved by ensuring that drawings and specifications are communicated to the  rest  of  the 
51 
52 	parties, should there be any changes. The parties affected by the changes can then promptly 
53 
54 	adjust their information and help to reduce the amount of time wasted. 	M

Construction specific factors were ranked as the fifth highest factor from the perspective of contractors and the fourth highest factor of architects, and the third highest factor on average. 
This shows that most of the contractors and architects know the value of construction specific factors and use it to improve the level of quality. This really implies the awareness of specific 
8 	ourna
67	factors such as the construction industry officials, associations, and governments. This is in 
9 agreement with findings of (Arditi and Gunaydin, 1997; Abdel- Razek, 1998; Lau and Tang, 
10 2009) as shown in Table 13.

16 	Companies that pursue construction specific factor will be able to reduce total quality cost and 
17 
19 Contractors and architectsof should  investigate the source of the specified requirements, namely, 18 improve product quality in the long run (Arditi and Gunaydin, 1997; Wanberg et al., 2013). 
20 
21 	the current standards and codes of practice as well as the specifications, since these may be 
23 ambiguous in certain aspects,Qualit and so difficult to conform to. Additionally, the consensus is that, 22 
24 in Jordan, contact with the government is basically done to obtain certain permits. This is 
25 
26 	usually done at both the earlyy and  the late stages of the project which indicates awareness of the 
27 
28 importance of construction specific factors. In the case of this survey, it can be clearly shown 
29 that there is a significant difference between architects and contractors, where architects give 30 
31 	higher concern regarding this factor. 
32 
33 
35 enhance quality practices, as stated in the study conducted in Singapore (Pheng and Wei, 1996). & 34 Therefore, contractors should pay more attention to construction specific factors in order to 
36 	Reliab
37 	The contractors, nevertheless, pay more attention to completing the works on schedule and 
38 
39 controlling the costs within budget than to achieving quality in construction. One reason for this 
40 might be that the contractors cannot plan and control the  works; they lack the skills to  interpret il 
41 
42 	the design and cannot provide the end products on site in accordance with the design and 
43 
44 specifications. Another reason is that the designers do  not consider the  “build ability”  problems 
45 in design. Designers are sometimes unaware of the difficulties contractors experience on site. 
46 
47 	Consequently, contractors do not realize that it is not the quality that costs but rather the non- 
48 
49 	conformance to quality that is expensive. 	ity

4.4 The Lowest Three Factors 
The lowest three factors in ascending order are resources, continuous improvement, and strategic management. Resources are the least important factor affecting quality in the Jordanian housing

8 ournaranked as ninth of those important factors from the  view point of architects.  Moreover,  there is sector. It is viewed as the least important from the perspective of contractors. This factor also 
7 
9 
10 no significant difference according to the mean of the overall average of the respondents. The 
11 l 
supported studies are summarized in Table 14. 
12 13 
14 	Table 14. Supportive Studies of Resources. 
15 
16 
17 	There is disagreement in our research with the study of Hellard (1991), where he stated that 19 	managers must organize their resources of men, materials, machines,  methods,  and  money of 18 
20 	within the framework of the law on one hand, and within the established customs and practices 
21 
23 	Qualit
22 	on the other – to achieve a balance and harmony through which the  stated objective  of  the 
24 	client’s building can be economically achieved. We agree with Both Metri (2005) and Abed- 
26 	y 
25 	Razek (1998), they showed little relative importance of the resources factor to improve 
27 	construction quality and concluded that it is a well-known fact that resources are mainly a part of 
28 
29 	top management commitment and partially of other factors. 
30 
31 	The contractors and architects appeared to agree statistically on the relative importance and 
32 
33 ranking of the continuous improvement. These results are in agreement with the outcomes of the 
34 research conducted in India by Metri  (2005) which &revealed  that a continuous improvement 
35 
36 	(benchmarking and statistical process control) are presented in very few frameworks inReliab literature 
37 
38 review, and they are the techniques used normally for process improvement. In the real sense, 
39 they are not considered as important factors; they are part of the routine process management. 
40 
41 	Hellard (1991) argued that use of statistical methods has relatively very little effect onil 	 the 
42 
43 quality of construction projects and that individual construction projects are unique and can 
44 eliminate the potential for any kind of statistical process control. However, there is a clear 45 
46 	disagreement with studies summarized in Table 15. 
47 
48 
49 	Table 15. Supportive Studies of Continuous Improvement 	ity 
50 
51 
52 As shown in Table 15, statistical techniques and benchmarking are the least applied tools in 
53 some countries,  but  widely used  in  specific countries   where  quality was  previously developedM  
54 
55 and considered as one of the most important factors, such as U.S.A (e.g. Arditi and Gunaydin, 
56 1997; Haupt and Whiteman, 2004) , Hong Kong (e.g. Lai and Cheng, 2003; Lam et al., 2008) 
5758  	,U.K (e.g. Oakland and Aldrdgie, 1995), Malaysia (e.g. Abdul - Alazi , 2002), and Singapore 59 
60 	(e.g. Pheng and Wei, 1996; Pheng and Teo, 2004). 

 
The previous work emphasized that continuous improvement will yield excellence in design and create teamwork. This quality factor is still not applied in Jordan in an integrated way and a little 
awareness regarding this new approach. The previous studies stressed the importance of quality improvement and measurement of product improvement. For example, statistical methods (e.g. 
8 	ourna
67	histograms, cause and effect diagrams, check sheets, Pareto diagrams, graphs, control charts, and 
9 scatter diagrams) provide problem-solving tools to the quality process (Arditi and Gunaydin, 1112   competitors and the high performing companies for improvement. 10 1997). Benchmarking is also researching and observing best competitive practices of direct 
13 
14 
15 Strategic Management was ranked as the tenth important factor according to contractors and 
16 eleventh lowest according to architects and twelfths lowest on averages. This result is in 
17 
19 	of 
18 	disagreement with findings summarized in Table 16. Moreover, there is significant difference 
20 	between the contractors and architects. 
21 
22 	Table 16. Supportive Studies of Strategic Management 
23 
24 
25 	Table 16 illustrates that construction companies in Singapore and Hong Kong regarding public 
26 
27 housing were in fact leading other countries in the area of strategic planning; perhaps other 
28 countries can use the public sector as a benchmark. Strategic planning is essential for integrating 
2930  	quality requirements and target improvements in the whole process and to examine how the 
31 
32 company develops and deploy strategic objectives and action plans, including short and long 
33 term planning and analyzing collected data. Some immediate measures should be taken to 
3435  	increase awareness regarding new management approaches for better quality strategies and 
36 	Reliab
37 	policies.

	 	5. Conclusion and Contributions 
8 In this research, the concept of quality can be defined from the viewpoints of contractors and architects Journ
9 combined as: al how closely the project conforms to its requirements and meeting the requirements of the 
10 
11 	designer,   constructor,   and   regulatory   agencies   as   well   as   the   owner.   This   research contributes 
12 
13 theoretically  in  providing  a  conceptual  framework  for  quality  factors  in  the  quality  field.  Figure  2
