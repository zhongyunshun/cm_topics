# Construction Management Publications Dataset and Analysis

This repository contains the dataset and analysis code for the publication "Leveraging Large Language Models with Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Trend Analysis in Construction Management Research". The dataset includes 1,100 construction management papers collected from Google Scholar, processed using GPT-4 to identify key research topics and trends.

## Repository Structure

- **`PDFs/`**: Construction Management Publication PDFs organized by Google Scholar result pages (e.g., `result_page_1_10/`, `additional pdf/`).
- **`TXTs/`**: UTF-8 text versions of PDFs for further analysis.
- **`Cleaned_TXTs/`**: Text files after data cleaning and pre-processing.
- **`topics_citation_dataset.xlsx`**: Final dataset containing metadata and annual citations (1980â€“2024), along with topic labels generated by GPT-4, LDA, and ground truth topics.
- **`co_occur_df.xlsx`**: Co-occurrence matrix of broad and fine-grained topics.
